Dir., Alberto Cardone\n\nA gunslinger with a grudge and two sidekicks rides into a small town looking for the bastard who did him wrong. The only hitch is that none of them knows who the varmint is or what he looks like. \n\nNever released on DVD or VHS, this spaghetti western is ripped from a screener tape.
