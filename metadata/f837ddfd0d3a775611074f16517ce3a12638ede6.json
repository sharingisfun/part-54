So, it stands to reason that if you enjoy the show, you'll enjoy this album (released to coincide with the start of the show's sixth season), which is based on the same sensibility. Romano begins by using an adjectival variant on the &quot;F&quot; word to express his wonder about appearing at Carnegie Hall. (The word is bleeped out even though everyone knows what he's saying, as a means of avoiding a parental advisory sticker ? rather like television, that.) His humor touches on enough risquÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© subjects to earn the album at least the equivalent of a PG-13 movie rating, but he is far from being a shock comic. His jokes and stories arise out of domestic situations, especially marriage and children. Affectionate pecks at his wife, funny observations about his children, and occasional bits of self-deprecation, all spoken in the accent and vocabulary of a working-class man from the Northeast suburbs, make for a likable comedic sensibility that anyone in young middle age can identify with. Sounds like an ideal persona to build a situation comedy around, doesn't it? As he says at the end of the performance, &quot;Keep watching.&quot; \n  \n \n      1  Carnegie Hall  Romano  1:42  \n       2  Italian and Jewish  Romano  5:37  \n       3  Bachelor Party  Romano  2:31  \n       4  Potato Chips  Romano  1:48  \n       5  Juice  Romano  1:17  \n       6  Stupid Joke  Romano  1:38  \n       7  Politically Incorrect Joke  Romano  :46  \n       8  Forty  Romano  3:28  \n       9  The Shower  Romano  2:35  \n       10  The Bed  Romano  4:32  \n       11  The Duties  Romano  3:23  \n       12  The Shopper  Romano  3:11  \n       13  Adult Movie  Romano  2:05  \n       14  The Baby  Romano  3:03  \n       15  Diapers  Romano  1:06  \n       16  2 Year-Olds  Romano  4:57  \n       17  Twins  Romano  3:45  \n       18  They Say Funny Things  Romano  2:11  \n       19  The Tub Story  Romano  1:58  \n       20  Sex  Romano  2:18","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f837ddfd0d3a775611074f16517ce3a12638ede6","amp;dn":"Standup+Comedy+-+Ray+Romano+-+Live+at+Carnegie+Hall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f837ddfd0d3a775611074f16517ce3a12638ede6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,55,221,253,13,58,119,86,17,7,79,22,81,124,227,161,38,56,237,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
