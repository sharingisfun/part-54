The traditional shader simply fades from one texture to the next, creating ugly, muddy looking transitions in many areas. The new shader uses alpha information added to each landscape texture to mask the textures when they are blended with the textures below them, producing crisp beautiful transitions that give the illusion of much greater detail in texture application. WhatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s more, this effect is achieved with practically no impact on performance!\n\nBUGS &amp; ISSUES\n\nThis is the first release of this mod, and the objective of the release is for players to test the project, look for bugs, bad textures, shader issues, hardware incompatibilities, and anything else that should turn up. Please post all your bug reports in one of our forum threads.\n\nCREDITS &amp; THANKS\n\nAlgorithm &amp; Textures: ChainsawXIV\nShader Implementation: Zeroed\n\nThe textures included in this mod are based on the terrain textures in Qarl\\&amp;#039;s Texture Pack, version three, and have been updated to include alpha channels with appropriate masking patterns.\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nDetailed Terrain comes packed as an OMOD file, for use with Oblivion Mod Manager (http://timeslip.chorrol.com/obmm.html). This format allows for easy management of the mod\\&amp;#039;s content, and is also used to update the game\\&amp;#039;s shaders. You must have Oblivion Mod Manager installed to use this mod. Once you have OMM, follow these simple instructions:\n\n1. Double-click the \\&quot;Detailed Terrain (Beta).omod\\&quot; file - it will open in Oblivion Mod Manager automatically.\n\n2. Select the mod on the list on OMM, and then click the Activate button. This will begin the process of unpacking the mod\\&amp;#039;s files.\n\n3. If you are using Qarl\\&amp;#039;s Texture pack, you will receive an overwrite warning. Detailed Terrain upgrades Qarl\\&amp;#039;s landscape textures, so you should choose to overwrite all the files in question.\n\n4. When everything is finished unpacking, you\\&amp;#039;re done. Simply click on the Launch Oblivion button to play.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49e9d127282b630f63404e702aae4d76749c2dd5","amp;dn":"TES4%3A+Oblivion+Mod+-+Detailed+Terrain+%28Beta%29+-+Version+0.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49e9d127282b630f63404e702aae4d76749c2dd5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,233,209,39,40,43,99,15,99,64,78,112,42,174,77,118,116,156,45,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
