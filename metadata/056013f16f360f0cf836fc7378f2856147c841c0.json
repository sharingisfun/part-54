With pianist Tommy Flanagan, guitarist Joe Pass, bassist Keter Betts, and drummer Bobby Durham serving as a backup group (not a bad band), she swings everything from &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; and &quot;It Don&amp;#039;t Mean a Thing&quot; to &quot;Lemon Drop&quot; and even Carole King&amp;#039;s &quot;You&amp;#039;ve Got a Friend.&quot; Her ballad interpretations are only topped by her scatting talents. This set serves as a perfect introduction to the mature Ella Fitzgerald.\n\nRecorded April 11, 1974 at Ronnie Scott&amp;#039;s, London, England.\n\nPersonnel:\nElla Fitzgerald - vocals\nTommy Flanagan Quartet:\nTommy Flanagan - piano\nJoe Pass - guitar\nKeter Betts - double bass\nBobby Durham - drums\n\nTrack listing:\n1. &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot; (Ben Bernie, Kenneth Casey, Maceo Pinkard) ? 3:15\n2. &quot;They Can&amp;#039;t Take That Away from Me&quot; (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) ? 4:12\n3. &quot;Ev&amp;#039;ry Time We Say Goodbye&quot; (Cole Porter) ? 2:57\n4. &quot;The Man I Love&quot; (G.
