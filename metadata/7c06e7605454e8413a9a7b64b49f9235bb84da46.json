The most well-known song remains one of the finer songs of \nthe decade. &amp;quot;Up-Up and Away&amp;quot; matched \nthe group's gorgeous harmonies with a great and ethereal yet full-bodied \nproduction. Their cover of the Mamas &amp;amp; the\n Papas' &amp;quot;Go Where You Want to Go&amp;quot; is such a carbon copy, Billy Davis Jr. \nprobably wore one of John Phillips' big \nhats for the session. Despite that groundbreaking song, Up, Up and Away is \nmostly the group finding their sound \nwith mixed results. The cover of &amp;quot;Poor Side of Town&amp;quot; is pointless and the \nMotown-inspired &amp;quot;I'll Be Loving You \nForever&amp;quot; comes off forced and as phony as a sack of three dollar bills. Up, Up \nand Away is certainly commendable \nfor the style forged here but even better work was ahead for the group. [The \n2001 reissue came with bonus tracks.\n\nenjoy and seed :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c06e7605454e8413a9a7b64b49f9235bb84da46","amp;dn":"5th+Dimention+-+Up%2C+Up+and+Away+%28Soul-1967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c06e7605454e8413a9a7b64b49f9235bb84da46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,6,231,96,84,84,232,65,58,154,123,100,180,159,146,53,187,132,218,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
