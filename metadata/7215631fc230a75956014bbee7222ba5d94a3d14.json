The whole of artistic creation was inspired by electro-industrial, gothic and ebm music as well as the poetry of Charles Baudelaire and William Blake.\n\nAt the beginning of 2006 the first demo entitled &quot;Newborn Monster&quot; (5 tracks) was released and what came after were the concerts in Warsaw, Cracow and Wroclaw.\n\nMonstergod had the pleasure of playing together with some widely known and acknowledged bands of electro-industrial and independent scene such as Architect, Destroid, Rotersand or Apoptygma Berzerk.\n\nThe tracks of the demo were frequently presented in German and Polish radio stations - Radio Hertz, Radio Frei, Radio Bis, Radio RAM, Streamelite.com.\n\n\n\nIn July 2006 the compilation &quot;Bright Lights, Dark Room - An Electro Tribute to Depeche Mode&quot; was published by the label Cryonica Music featuring the interpretation of &quot;Fly On The Windscreen&quot; made by MonsterGod.\n\nAt the end of 2006 the track &quot;Obsession&quot; was included on the CD attached to the German magazine Dark Spy as well as on the CD that sums up the Polish project Mediageneracja.\n\n\nCHECK OUT their myspace and please help support this NEW artist!  - THX and help me SEED please?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7215631fc230a75956014bbee7222ba5d94a3d14","amp;dn":"MonsterGod+-+Reborn+Monster+%282008%29+%2B+God%5C%27s+Verses+EP+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7215631fc230a75956014bbee7222ba5d94a3d14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,21,99,31,194,48,167,89,86,1,75,190,231,34,43,165,217,74,61,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
