Fans and critics alike generally regard the album as an extremely important record in the history of rock music, citing the lasting influence it&amp;#039;s had on subsequent punk musicians.\n\nThe album was released on October 28, 1977 on the Virgin Records label,[1] amid controversy arising from the use of the obscenity (in British English) &quot;bollocks&quot; in its title.\n\nOlder versions of most of the album&amp;#039;s songs also appeared on a bootleg album called Spunk, which consists of demo recordings the band had made during 1976 and January 1977, and which was released shortly before Never Mind the Bollocks.\n\n\n1.
