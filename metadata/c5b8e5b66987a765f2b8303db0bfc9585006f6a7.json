Enjoy!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere\\&amp;#039;s the story.  I am converting all of my old \\&quot;Fan Tapes\\&quot; over from VHS to DVD and also ripping them to AVI files.\nHopefully I can post up some things that are hard to find and help add to other peoples collections. There is a lot of \nof animation as well as some live action.  Sorry if the quality  is lacking on some of these old shows. Please try to \nremember that they are coming off of home recorded video tapes. Some of them are copies of copies and the tapes\nhave been in storage for a while. I have my system set for the best quality rip I can get, but I can only do so much.\nWould love to hear feedback!  SHARING IS CARING!  ..........oh yeah, PIRATE BAY IS THE BEST!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5b8e5b66987a765f2b8303db0bfc9585006f6a7","amp;dn":"3+George+of+the+Jungle+cartoons+and+a+Super-Chicken","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5b8e5b66987a765f2b8303db0bfc9585006f6a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,184,229,182,105,135,167,101,242,184,48,61,176,191,201,88,80,6,246,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
