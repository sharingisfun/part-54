This will get seeded though it may take up to two days.\n\nThis is one of the greatest compilations I&amp;#039;ve had the pleasure to listen to. Every track has a unique quality that sets it apart from the genre it has grown from.\n\nTracklist\n=========\n\n1       Van Morrison   \t       T.B. Sheets\n2 \tGeorge McCrae \t       I Get Lifted\n3 \tLiquid Liquid \t       Lock Groove (In)\n4 \tCan \t               Vitamin C\n5 \tSerge Gainsbourg       En Melody\n6 \tCharly Ace &amp; Fay*      Punanny\n7 \tTom Browne \t       Fungi Mama\n8 \tMiles Davis \t       Black Satin (Album Version)\n9 \tEddie Bo \t       Hook &amp; Sling Pt 1\n10 \tOne Way \t       Hold It\n11 \tPeter Brown (2)        Penguin\n12 \tMamba Percussions      Samba\n13 \tQPSM Unit \t       Brooklyn Inferno Quadraphonic\n14 \tNina Simone \t       Funkier Than A Mosquito&amp;#039;s Tweeter (Live)\n15 \tFranÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ois De Roubaix    Dernier Domicile Connu\n16 \tJohn Carpenter \t       The End (Remix)\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/395684&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/395684&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLock Groove - Great track from the New York &amp;#039;No Wave&amp;#039; scene. A combination of latin vibes and experimental white boy punk.\n\nSamba - One of the most dense and uplifting pieces of latin music you&amp;#039;re likely to hear. Accessable Jazz percussion that will have you groovin.\n\nFunkier than a... One of the finest Nina tracks ever to hit wax. Full of soul and funk with groans that only she could pull off.\n\nI first heard The End remix on an Optimo (uk) mix and was surprised to find it here. Before, I had always thought it was one of their own re-edits.\n\nI could go on and on about how great each of these tracks is but I&amp;#039;ll just leave you to have a listen for yourself.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c89ae9644b50d7090ab2c12a9b35294e207625a","amp;dn":"VA+Life+Styles+-+Compiled+By+Laurent+Garnier+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c89ae9644b50d7090ab2c12a9b35294e207625a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,137,174,150,68,181,13,112,144,171,44,18,169,179,82,148,226,7,98,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
