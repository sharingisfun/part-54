This was a finalist in the 2002 Unequal Forces Game Design Competition. \nGame rules are quite sophisticated, you can view details at http://takat-game.net/content/view/13/27/ but i guess many logical board fans will find this game attractive.\nThe basic rule is to put 6 stones stack on one piece while playing white, or to don&amp;#039;t allow to make mentioned stack while playing black.\n\nThe program requires Microsoft .NET Framework. The .NET Framework is currently bundled with most of new computers running Windows XP. If you have an older computer and can not start a program, the .NET Framework is probably not installed on your PC and you would have to download it through Windows Update web site: http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bc1b8cf3e22c5e3b83db7a0895dcef4929f395b","amp;dn":"Takat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bc1b8cf3e22c5e3b83db7a0895dcef4929f395b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,193,184,207,62,34,197,227,184,61,183,160,137,93,206,244,146,159,57,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
