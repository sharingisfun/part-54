This time he has been recruited by an elite \n  international peacekeeping organization - which means new larger-than-\n  life capers, new gadgets and a new set of assistants: the Gadgetinis \n  - a group of tiny robotic versions of Inspector Gadget who are \n  frequently the unintended victims of his bumbling. But in the end, \n  thanks to his heart of gold, his indefatigable spirit and a little \n  help from his brilliant niece Penny, Gadget always manages to save \n  the day.\n\n\n  Features\n\n    4 exciting worlds to explore: Las Vegas, China, The Womp Offices,\n    And of course the Mad Base! \n\n    2 Game Modes for a varied playing experience: Platform mode \n    starring Gadget!
