Easy to download, install and use, McAfee VirusScan automatically checks for virus updates whenever you connect to the Internet, so your protection stays up-to-date against the latest threats, including spyware.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e93cd7f4006ed98c58f6af2b249eecf5e92e4b38","amp;dn":"McAfee+VirusScan+Home+9.0.10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e93cd7f4006ed98c58f6af2b249eecf5e92e4b38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,60,215,244,0,110,217,140,88,246,175,43,36,158,236,245,233,46,75,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
