Errol Flynn is the star but this was truly an ensemble of talented actors that made the story the star.\n\nIMDB:\nIt&amp;#039;s two years after the Nazi&amp;#039;s invasion of Norway and in a small fishing village that is headquarters to 150 German soldiers, the 800 locals are stewing, waiting for a supply of arms so they can revolt. Leaders include Karen Stensgard, whose father is the town&amp;#039;s doctor and not all that sure that an open revolt will accomplish much and whose brother has proven disloyal to Norway previously, and Gunnar Brogge, a fisherman who was planning to sail to England to fight but changed his mind on hearing of English arms being delivered. Although the Nazi&amp;#039;s cruelty is evident, the townspeople bide their time, until one incident causes the stewpot to boil over.
