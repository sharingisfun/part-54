Most didn&amp;#039;t survive.\n--\nAs Hitler&amp;#039;s armies swept all before them in Europe they brought with them a new concept in terror. One woman, a New Zealand born Australian living in France was thrown into the act of involvement to stand against this. Her name was Nancy Wake. \n\nfor two and a half years she assisted the escape of thousands of allied servicemen and others wanted by the Germans, across southern France to the safety of neutral spain.\n\nShe proved so daring and effective that Gestapo headquarters in Berlin considered her the most wanted woman of the Second World War.\n\nAfter her own escape to England, Nancy was trained by S.O.E as an agent and parachuted back into occupied France to work and fight alongside some of the toughest &quot;Marquis&quot; fighters in the French Resistance.\n\nHer story is one of daring of courage, of hardship and deep personal loss and sacrifice.\n\nShe was one of the most highly decorated women of the Second World War.\n\n\n--------------------\n\nurl=http://www.4freeimagehost.com] [img]http://www.4freeimagehost.com/uploads/fea80373408c.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.4freeimagehost.com] [img]http://www.4freeimagehost.com/uploads/641a36748714.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n \n[url=http://www.4freeimagehost.com] [img]http://www.4freeimagehost.com/uploads/7a207a6c5abc.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n[url=http://www.4freeimagehost.com] [img]http://www.4freeimagehost.com/uploads/8fe922204859.jpg[/img][/url]\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d75f4d6938f294c5e6adee5c3c1c1010a622470","amp;dn":"Nancy.Wake.codename.The.White.Mouse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d75f4d6938f294c5e6adee5c3c1c1010a622470","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,117,244,214,147,143,41,76,94,106,222,229,195,193,193,1,10,98,36,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
