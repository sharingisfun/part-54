It&amp;#039;s just too small. With that in mind, I try to Rip all my movies to either look great or at least decent on a TV screen so the quality is good. Usually I use a 1400 bit rate but it makes the files huge, so I went with half that on this one. Still looks better then most iPod DVD Rips.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90fdda7cba427606b42e783df407a7ce2ca84cbc","amp;dn":"School+Of+Rock+%28DVD_Rip+for+iPod%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90fdda7cba427606b42e783df407a7ce2ca84cbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,253,218,124,186,66,118,6,180,46,120,61,244,7,167,206,44,168,76,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
