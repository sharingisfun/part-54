Rebreather (Pt. 1)\n2. Industrial Boy (Feat. Kenji Siratori)\n3. Deadly*\n4. Beeswax\n5. Vehicularism*\n6. Hull Breach\n\nFrom the artist&amp;#039;s site: &quot;Pejorative is the first official release from Freeze Etch in over four years (following 2003&amp;#039;s Helios EP). This self-released, severely limited and hand-numbered EP comes in an edition of 100 copies, packaged in vintage CD-ROM caddies featuring additional design by Eric Carl.\n\n&quot;Pejorative contains six previously unreleased tracks - including a spoken-word collaboration with notorious cyberpunk author Kenji Siratori, as well as two tracks (*) from the first-ever full-length Freeze Etch album, &quot;Vessels,&quot; to be released soon on Force Of Nature. Get a copy while you can!&quot;\n\nYou can get a physical copy (very limited release) and check out Freeze Etch&amp;#039;s other stuff at http://freezeetch.com.\n\nThis is a CC-licensed album but I don&amp;#039;t think anyone has actually gone about making a torrent of this album yet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17f88ba81bcfb4a2ef27ac8a11dffb5ad5f94647","amp;dn":"Freeze+Etch+-+Pejorative+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17f88ba81bcfb4a2ef27ac8a11dffb5ad5f94647","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,248,139,168,27,207,180,162,239,39,172,138,17,223,251,90,213,249,70,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
