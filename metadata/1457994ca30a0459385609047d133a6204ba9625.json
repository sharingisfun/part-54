OCTOBER 2008***\nThis is no longer being seeded by me, nor, does it appear, by anyone else.\nI've uploaded it here: http://solidfiles.com/d/7bfbd51b81ae70eb494bd70bfe37b7e3\n\n\nI bought this game back in the 90s by faxing an order form and receiving floppies by mail...can you believe we used to do it that way?\n\nAnyway, this is a fun old platformer that works seamlessly in the latest build of DosBOX (and, to my knowledge, VDMSound).\n\nI don't know if anyone wants this, but here you go. I'll seed for a month or so.\n\nSparky","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1457994ca30a0459385609047d133a6204ba9625","amp;dn":"Last+Knight+at+Camelot+%28DOS%29+-+Retail","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1457994ca30a0459385609047d133a6204ba9625","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,87,153,76,163,10,4,89,56,86,9,4,125,19,58,98,4,186,150,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
