Burke and co-produced with Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal for TriBeCa Productions in 1993. The series theme song, &quot;Keep It Going,&quot; was performed by the alternative hip hop artist Me Phi Me.\n\nFor his performance in the lead role of Martin McHenry in the season opener, &quot;The Box,&quot; Laurence Fishburne won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor - Drama Series.\n\nNoted for attracting ÃƒÂ¢??actors, writers and directors of uncommon quality,ÃƒÂ¢?? and set in New York City&amp;#039;s lower Manhattan neighborhood of TriBeCa, the series was aired by the Fox Broadcasting Company. The stellar casts, with series regulars Philip Bosco and Joe Morton, included Eli Wallach, Kevin Spacey, Kathleen Quinlan, Melanie Mayron, Judith Malina, Carl Lumbly, Richard Lewis, Carol Kane, Debbie Harry, Dizzy Gillespie and Danny Aiello III.\n\nDirectors and scriptwriters included David J. Burke, Hans Tobeason, John Mankiewicz of the prolific Mankiewicz family, Barry Primus, Bryan Spicer and several actors in the series, among others.\n\n\n\nThis is a low quality rip from a VHS tape of the TV broadcast back in 1993. \n\nVideo #0\nCodec                : DivX 4\nWidth                : 720 pixels\nHeight               : 480 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio : 4/3\nFrame rate           : 23.976 fps\nStandard             : NTSC\n\nAudio #0\nCodec                : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nCodec profile        : Joint stereo\nBit rate             : 128 Kbps\nBit rate mode        : CBR\nChannel(s)           : 2 channels\nSampling rate        : 48 KHz\nResolution           : 16 bits\nWriting library      : Xing (new)\n\nThis is not available anywhere for purchase as far as I know which is why I am uploading it. It&amp;#039;s superb drama even if there were only 7 episodes total, all of which I will upload once I know what I am doing, unless they come out on DVD in which case I can discard the low quality tape I have.\n\nThis is my first upload so if I screwed something up or if anyone has any tips just let me know. \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7858a95d2eb0ddc59b42c8ddbcdf437ea3c8650f","amp;dn":"Tribeca+TV+S1E01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7858a95d2eb0ddc59b42c8ddbcdf437ea3c8650f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,88,169,93,46,176,221,197,155,66,200,221,188,223,67,126,163,200,101,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
