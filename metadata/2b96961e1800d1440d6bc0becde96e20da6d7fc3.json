This App does the trick. It is the Rosetta Stone 2.1.4.1A CD. The OSX version gives me all sorts of pains, but the Classic version doesn&amp;#039;t ask any questions like what&amp;#039;s the password or access key or anything else I don&amp;#039;t know the answer to. If you are a mac user and have trouble opening your version 2 language disk (like Farsi), this is the app for you.\n\nThis is my first torrent though so I dunno if I did it right.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b96961e1800d1440d6bc0becde96e20da6d7fc3","amp;dn":"Rosetta+Stone+2.1.4.1A+for+Mac+OS+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b96961e1800d1440d6bc0becde96e20da6d7fc3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,150,150,30,24,0,209,68,13,107,192,190,205,233,110,32,218,109,127,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
