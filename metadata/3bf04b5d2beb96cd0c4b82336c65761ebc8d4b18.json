See in Windows documentation for details. In this mode doesn&amp;#039;t matter (in opposite to &quot;clone&quot; mode&quot;) difference in size and resolution of all displays. With MCE Mover you will be able to move Windows Media Center user interface from monitor with high resolution, which is supposed to be used for watching videos etc. to small monitor with low resolution to choose some music to play without necessity to switch main monitor (plasma, projector) on.\n\nOff course when watching videos or TV you can move MCE UI back to main monitor.\n\nThis action can be done simply by pressing two-button combination on your MCE remote control. \n\n\n==================================== &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mcemover.com/Default.aspx&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mcemover.com/Default.aspx&lt;/a&gt;\n====================================\n\n===========================================\n=============Installation==================\n===========================================\n\n1]-Install by running &amp;#039;mcemover-demo.exe&amp;#039;\n\n2]-Replace original exe by the one from the &amp;#039;Crack&amp;#039;-folder\n\nHave fun\n\nCracked by Pino, used Ollydbg, ResHacker, DeDe.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bf04b5d2beb96cd0c4b82336c65761ebc8d4b18","amp;dn":"MCEMover+%2B+Crack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bf04b5d2beb96cd0c4b82336c65761ebc8d4b18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,240,75,93,43,235,150,205,12,75,130,51,108,101,118,30,188,141,75,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
