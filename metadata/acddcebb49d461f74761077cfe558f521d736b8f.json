The Green Manalishi (With The Two-Pronged Crown)\n2. Screaming For Vengeance\n3. The Sentinel\n4. Diamonds And Rust (So what, it&amp;#039;s a cover. Still a great song)\n5. Painkiller\n6. Electric Eye\n7. Sinner\n8. The Ripper\n9. Tyrant\n10. Rock Forever\n\nYeah, I know there are some songs that are better than Sinner or Rock Forever. But I&amp;#039;m trying to get my friend to open up to Judas Priest and stop his bitching about me listening to it, and I believe these are the best songs to do that.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acddcebb49d461f74761077cfe558f521d736b8f","amp;dn":"Top+10+Judas+Priest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acddcebb49d461f74761077cfe558f521d736b8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,221,206,187,73,212,97,247,71,97,7,124,254,85,143,82,29,115,107,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
