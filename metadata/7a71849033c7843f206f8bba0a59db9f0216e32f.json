Keymaster ( Instrumental ) (11:01)\n\nThis is a very rare and beautiful bootleg. With the exception of Beach House Reality ( working title for 6:00 ),\nLifting Shadows Off A Dream and Caught In A Web all of the demos on this two disc set are previously unreleased .\nThe aforementioned three songs were originally pressed on the rare silver ( internet only ) bootleg Scenes From A\nMemory ( Prism/PR-0496) some eight years ago ( indeed before 1999 there was already a Dream Theater CD called \nScenes From A Memory , a bootleg though , but still :-)\nWith the release of this bootleg we're at last given the chance to hear ALL the songs that Dream Theater demo-ed some \nmonths prior to the official recording of Awake in the best sound available . \nThis is the second Dream Theater release on this Japanese label ( the first being First Season , Langley Ultimate Series - 180 ).\nI'm wondering how on earth a Japanese bootlegger could get hold of these very rare recordings and with a small run of only \n300 copies it's fair to say that this title will be one of the rare and most sought after bootlegs in Dream Theater land.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a71849033c7843f206f8bba0a59db9f0216e32f","amp;dn":"Dream+Theater+-+%5C%22The+Awake+Demos%5C%22+1994+%28192+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a71849033c7843f206f8bba0a59db9f0216e32f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,113,132,144,51,199,132,63,32,111,139,186,10,89,219,159,2,22,227,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
