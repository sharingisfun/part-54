From Poncho Sanchez?s invitation to party with his cha cha-infused version of ?One Mint Julep? to Tito Puente?s timeless hit ?Oye Como Va,? from Mongo Santamaria?s incessantly grooving cover of the Beatles? ?Day Tripper? to Caribbean Jazz Project?s inventive morphing of cha cha rhythms in 5/4 time on ?Tell Me a Bedtime Story,? this cherry-picked set of soulful cha cha cha and funky guajira belongs in any feel-good music collection.\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.
