I put [Maga]Zine torrents together, which includes games and firmwares for 5g and 5.5g iPods. I also updated the iPodWizard program with the latest version. The following instructions were written by [Maga]Zine and unchanged by myself (well written and easy to follow).\n\n\nInstallation Instructions\nStep 1: Extract the RAR file from the torrent.\nStep 2: Plug in your iPod.  Make sure it is enabled for disk use, and the &quot;Do Not Disconnect&quot; logo is flashing.\nStep 3: Open up your iPod in &quot;My Computer&quot;.  Enable hidden files and folders in &quot;Folder Options&quot;.\nStep 4: Open up the &quot;iPod_Control&quot; folder.\nStep 5: Paste the &quot;Games_RO&quot; folder into the &quot;iPod_Control&quot; folder.\nStep 6: Open up iPodWizard (it&amp;#039;s a standalone file, no need to install)\nStep 7: Change the edit mode to &quot;Firmware File&quot;.\nStep 8: Click &quot;Open Firmware&quot; and choose either &quot;5g Firmware.bin&quot; or &quot;5.5g Firmware.bin&quot; based on weather you have a 5g or a 5.5g iPod.  If you choose the wrong one, you will have to boot into disk mode and restore your iPod.\nStep 9: Click &quot;Write to iPod&quot;\nStep 10: Follow the instructions on the screen.  Eject the iPod when it is done.\nStep 11: Reset your iPod by holding in the center button and play/pause button until the apple logo appears\nStep 12: Go to Extras &gt; Games on your iPod, choose your game, and enjoy.\n\n\nMade by [Maga]Zine / Updated by seirio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4390130c8c7896fc9969f5d827dd82acdc743530","amp;dn":"iPod+20+Games+THIS+REALLY+WORKS%21+%285g%2B5.5g+iPods+only%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4390130c8c7896fc9969f5d827dd82acdc743530","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,144,19,12,140,120,150,252,153,105,245,216,39,221,130,172,220,116,53,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
