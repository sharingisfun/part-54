In\n2007 he was awarded the coveted number 1 position as &quot;DJ of the world&quot; by\nreaders of the British music magazine &quot;DJ Mag&quot;. 2008 has also brought him\nfame and good fortune, being the winner of the prestigious Dutch Pop\nPrize. Currently he is getting ready for his third &quot;Armin Only&quot; concert.\nThe previous two editions were held in the Ahoy in Rotterdam, but this\nyear on Saturday April 19th all eyes will be on the man himself as he\ntakes his place behind the decks at the Jaarbeurs in Utrecht, playing to\nmore than 15,000 dance fans. The theme of this years Armin Only will be\n&quot;Imagine&quot;, the same title of his soon to be released album that he has\nlabored on for these past two years.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d840723b185252ccb58f0f748ed6c666d8b63c11","amp;dn":"Armin_Van_Buuren-Imagine-CD-2008-TGX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d840723b185252ccb58f0f748ed6c666d8b63c11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,64,114,59,24,82,82,204,181,143,15,116,142,214,198,102,216,182,60,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
