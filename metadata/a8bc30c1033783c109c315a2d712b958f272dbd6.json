The 4-CD Zappa MOFO Project/Object in glorious 320kb/s mp3. This four CD box is described as the Making Of Freak Out! by The Mothers Of Invention, Frank Zappa&amp;#039;s early band. \n\nThe first dic is the original stereo vinyl mix of Freak Out!, not the 1980&amp;#039;s Ryko master, which kinda sucked. \n\nThe three additional CDs are comprised of outtakes, alternate versions, backing tracks, interviews and more.\n\nI&amp;#039;ll be seeding this one non-stop for as long as I can. It took me forever to download this off some nearly forgotten torrent with rare seeding. Now I&amp;#039;m posting it here to keep it alive. Seed as long as you can!\n\nDisc 1 Freak Out!
