Four of the six singles issued from Faith went to number one in America, while by comparison, none managed to do so in the UK.\n\n&quot;One More Try&quot; was the third consecutive #1 single from the Faith album. &quot;One More Try&quot; debuted at an impressive #40 the week of April 16, 1988, and matching the speed of &quot;Father Figure&quot;, reached #1 by its seventh week, May 28, 1988, this time staying there for three consecutive weeks. &quot;One More Try&quot; was the second-longest running #1 of 1988, tied with &quot;Every Rose Has Its Thorn&quot; by Poison, and behind the four-week run of Steve Winwood&amp;#039;s &quot;Roll With It&quot;. In total, &quot;One More Try&quot; spent 7 weeks in the Top 10 and 14 weeks in the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;One More Try&quot; was the last number-one single on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart by a white male artist until Robin Thicke&amp;#039;s &quot;Lost Without U&quot; (2007). \n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f1b981743316a8aca23ef082da09e356f40bac2","amp;dn":"George+Michael+-+One+More+Try","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f1b981743316a8aca23ef082da09e356f40bac2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,27,152,23,67,49,106,138,202,35,239,8,45,160,158,53,111,64,186,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
