His fan base disintegrated after this was shown on the video channels. According to Miss Squier the video &quot;wreaked havoc on my career&quot;.\n\nJustice, I say. \n\nReview by William S. Repsher of leisuresuit.net\n\nWith this album, Billy Squier ruled the rock roost with hit after hit: The Stroke, In the Dark and Lonely Is the Night; He could do no wrong in 1981. This album was a how-to guide on becoming a superstar, and damn few artists could write it. I wanted to hate Don't Say No, and when friends first played it, I did as much. But after a few listens, I realized that this guy simply had a great pop sense. Album tracks like Too Daze Gone, I Need You and Nobody Knows made this a solid effort and showed he could be more than a flash in a pan.\n\nSo why, then, was he? This can be traced to a video he did for his 1984 single Rock Me Tonight. Not a bad song at all--but the video was Billy prancing around an apartment in a Flashdance-style ripped sweatshirt and tights. The way he danced . . . oh, he looked terrible. All his die-heard fans I knew said: &quot;Man, doesn't Billy look like a fag in the video for 'Rock Me Tonight&quot;  It put his career on a lower trajectory, and signaled a weird change in rock. New wave guys could come off like &quot;fags&quot; -it was expected. But a rock star? No way, man! If you did so, you had to over-compensate with pseudo-macho blathering to offset any hint of androgyny, a la Motley Crue and Poison. Billy Squier was better than that, but his rock-and-roll dice were rolled, and they came up snake eyes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:080250fed02a1d7718fff5a6e2d32c2dc5d3328c","amp;dn":"Billy+Squier+-+Rock+Me+Tonite+-+Sucky+Music+Video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"080250fed02a1d7718fff5a6e2d32c2dc5d3328c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,2,80,254,208,42,29,119,24,255,245,166,226,211,44,45,197,211,50,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
