This is done just to avoid having the sloppy DOS window in the background. Some AVs complain with it recognizing RunHiddenConsole.exe as a malicious/potentially harmful program as it can be used to hide malicious behaviours. If it&amp;#039;s your case, or just don&amp;#039;t trust in the first one, just use the second version.\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb61137a66f4c231bbab7d31ce49e08e85ebc2cb","amp;dn":"nLite+v1.4.7+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb61137a66f4c231bbab7d31ce49e08e85ebc2cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,97,19,122,102,244,194,49,187,171,125,49,206,73,224,142,133,235,194,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
