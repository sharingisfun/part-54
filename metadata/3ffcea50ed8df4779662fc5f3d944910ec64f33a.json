More information at http://meetthegimp.org\n\nThis work is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Germany License.\t\n\n\n\nEpisode 039: Different Tones and a View into the NEAR Future\n\nI have some very nice news about the upcoming version 2.6 of GIMP. Exclusively for Meet the GIMP! before it will hit the mailing lists tomorrow.\n\nThe rest of the show covers toning monochrome images and includes a new feature - the Blunder Alert Overlay?. The image here is a tritone of blue in the shadows, red in the midtones and orange in the highlights.\n\nThe slideshow for the monochrome challenge and the fully randomized drawing of the winner will be on next week. I hadn?t looked on my calendar when I set the 31th of March as the final date. Next challenge will end on Tuesday, then I have a week to make the stuff ready.\n\nI have some links for you:\n\n    * rore?s split tone example from flickr\n    * The GIMP users group discussion there\n    * Duotone in Wikipedia\n    * Gimpforum.de has the screenshot, not gimpusers. Sorry for the mix up.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ffcea50ed8df4779662fc5f3d944910ec64f33a","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_039_Toning","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ffcea50ed8df4779662fc5f3d944910ec64f33a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,252,234,80,237,141,244,119,150,98,252,95,61,148,73,16,236,100,243,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
