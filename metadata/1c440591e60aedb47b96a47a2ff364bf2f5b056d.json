With legendary performances by Otis Redding, the Who, Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, the Byrds, and Paul Butterfield all taken from the mobile-unit multi-track masters (not to mention an album-sized booklet that'll knock your eyes out), this box evokes a sound and an era the way few (if any) retrospectives of like material ever do. Important music from a turning point in rock's history. \n \n\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;token=ADFEAEE47B16DE4DAF7620D6972B4DDBB177D20AD14EF28B136E5950C0B7261DD85F23FD0BBAD8CEAEF875B47DE3FC24A55F05D6C2FE2781&amp;sql=10:81jieay04xu7","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c440591e60aedb47b96a47a2ff364bf2f5b056d","amp;dn":"Monterey+International+Pop+Festival+June+16-17-18+1967+4CD%40VBR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c440591e60aedb47b96a47a2ff364bf2f5b056d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,68,5,145,230,10,237,180,123,150,164,122,47,243,100,191,47,91,5,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
