It was a proclamation that they would rail against and knock down anything that stood in their way; it would become a \nbanner adopted by millions who wanted to turn their dead-end street into a freeway. Four years later, when the band is closer to its \ndestination than its members ever had any right to expect, Guns n&amp;#039; Roses release two follow-up albums: Use Your Illusion I and II. The \ntitle is a confession; now that the physical barriers are gone and nothing stands in their way except maybe their own myth, they&amp;#039;ve got \nto set their sights on something less tangible. &quot;Old at heart,&quot; Axl Rose sings on &quot;Estranged,&quot; from II, &quot;but I&amp;#039;m only twenty-eight.&quot; Like \nAerosmith in the classic &quot;Dream On,&quot; they realize that to go on, you&amp;#039;ve got to have faith.\nDuring the fifty-three and a half minutes of Appetite, the guitars antagonized, the drums slammed, and Axl howled about their savage \nlifestyle, the perils of drugs, the glory of booze, dreaming of Eden, wide-eyed romantic love, their oppressors and sex. Old-fashioned \nrock &amp; roll stuff, it proved they were hard; it proved they were bad; it proved that metal could rise again; it sold 14 million copies and \nremained on the charts for three years. During the seventy-five and a half minutes of Use Your Illusion II, the guitars antagonize, \nthough now with more dexterity, varying in tempo and mood; the drums slam, though now at the hands of new band member Matt \nSorum; and Axl of course howls, but he also whispers, croons, talk-sings and plays piano like he did back in Indiana, up in his room, \nidolizing Elton John. In the four years that have passed since Guns n&amp;#039; Roses first combined opposing symbols and upset the apple cart \nwith willful disregard for rock &amp; roll legend, interest in the band hasn&amp;#039;t waned: 18,000 people will actually wait for them to come out \nonstage two hours late; the single &quot;You Could Be Mine,&quot; off II and featured in Terminator 2, has sold nearly 2 million copies; and the \nband&amp;#039;s slightest misstep becomes controversy and turns established magazines and newspapers into veritable Guns n&amp;#039; Roses fanzines. \nNo wonder they take themselves so seriously.\nWith Use Your Illusion II, the band rewards the loyal legions ? with fourteen songs, which range from ballad to battle, pretty to vulgar, \nworldly to incredibly naive. The seven-minute power ballad &quot;Civil War,&quot; which opens the album (and which previously appeared on the \nRomanian orphan-relief album Nobody&amp;#039;s Child), begins with fingers studiously squeaking on acoustic-guitar strings and a few lines of \ndialogue from Cool Hand Luke, then drops the band&amp;#039;s characteristic patriotism for amplified rage and a sober look at political deceit: \n&quot;So I never fell for Vietnam/We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all/That you can&amp;#039;t trust freedom when it&amp;#039;s not in your hands.&quot; Because \nthe band is reaching beyond its own experience on this song, Axl&amp;#039;s question &quot;What&amp;#039;s so civil &amp;#039;bout war, anyway?&quot; ? backed by \nthunderclaps and rainfall ? is almost excusable. The outstanding cover of Bob Dylan&amp;#039;s &quot;Knockin&amp;#039; on Heaven&amp;#039;s Door&quot; is epic, beautiful and \nheartfelt, with little flourishes like guns cocking behind the obvious verse (&quot;Mama put my guns in the ground/I can&amp;#039;t shoot them \nanymore&quot;) and Axl wailing as only Axl does, through his discolored teeth, turning vowels into primitive cries of pain or resolve. Quite a \nfew songs mine the territory of love gone awry: the spiteful &quot;14 Years,&quot; the disillusioned &quot;Locomotive,&quot; the lonely (and very long) \n&quot;Estranged&quot; and the bittersweet &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Cry&quot; (a different version from the one that appears on I), which is chapter 2 of &quot;Sweet Child o&amp;#039; \nMine,&quot; the song that, at least in the summer of &amp;#039;88, bridged the distance between rural route and urban drawing room. The clunkers on \nII are &quot;Shotgun Blues,&quot; a sonic assault with surprisingly little impact, and &quot;Get in the Ring,&quot; which challenges the band&amp;#039;s detractors by \nname but basically hits below the belt. On Appetite it was &quot;Feel my serpentine&quot;; on Illusion II it&amp;#039;s &quot;Suck my fuckin&amp;#039; dick&quot; ? meant in a \ndifferent spirit, yes, but it&amp;#039;s beneath them just the same.\nAxl Rose has stopped teasing his hair, taken a few of the chains off his cowboy boots, left the pink lipstick to Skid Row&amp;#039;s Sebastian Bach \nand gotten a bit of perspective. So he shouldn&amp;#039;t be bothered by his critics, because even with years of practice, no one has come close \nto that snaky dance of his, that dance that whips victimization, menace and struggle into one fluid, triumphant motion.
