He&amp;#039;s so good, he makes everyone else look bad. As a result, Angel&amp;#039;s superiors send him to a place where his talents won&amp;#039;t be quite so embarrassing - the sleepy and seemingly crime-free village of Sandford. Once there, he is partnered with the well-meaning but overeager police officer Danny Butterman. The son of amiable Police Chief Frank Butterman, Danny is a huge action movie fan and believes his new big-city partner might just be a real-life &quot;bad boy,&quot; and his chance to experience the life of gunfights and car chases he so longs for. Angel is quick to dismiss this as childish fantasy and Danny&amp;#039;s puppy-like enthusiasm only adds to Angel&amp;#039;s growing frustration. However, as a series of grisly accidents rocks the village, Angel is convinced that Sandford is not what it seems and as the intrigue deepens, Danny&amp;#039;s dreams of explosive, high-octane, car-chasing, gunfighting, all-out action seem more and more like a reality. It&amp;#039;s time for these small-town cops to break out some big-city justice.\n\nSEED AFTER YOU !!!!\nSEEDA EFTER ER !!!!\n\nBESÃƒâ€“K GÃƒâ€žRNA LÃƒâ€žNKARNA IN TORRENTEN!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:633bfd266b017082c4e327dd1945696c8b06a055","amp;dn":"Hot.Fuzz%5B2007%5DDvDRip%5BEng%5D-TheBlaBla","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"633bfd266b017082c4e327dd1945696c8b06a055","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,59,253,38,107,1,112,130,196,227,39,221,25,69,105,108,139,6,160,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
