The 1960s saw many former stars struggling as rock swept the popular music scene, and having been one of the greatest of all jazz singers for three decades, Fitzgerald did as so many others did: depending your on point of view, she either sold out or made a brave attempt to move with the times. These two sets, and the second is much stronger than the first, are very much of their era--a mix of pop, soul, R&amp;B and MOR infused with as much jazz as Ella could squeeze into the sessions. It&amp;#039;s a sometimes infectious brew, as on the rousing version of Randy Newman&amp;#039;s &quot;I Wonder Why&quot;, though &quot;Black Coffee&quot; finds Fitzgerald on much more rewarding territory, her voice as fine as ever when the music really allows her to shine. &quot;Willow Weep For Me&quot; is one of several gems from the second album, and though Ella gives her all throughout, when she belts out Duke Ellington&amp;#039;s &quot;Things Ain&amp;#039;t What They Used To Be&quot; you know she&amp;#039;s singing from the heart.\n\nTrack listing:\n1.
