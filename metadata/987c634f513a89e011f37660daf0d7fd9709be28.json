After installation, SoftCopy appears as just another Windows printer to all your applications. When you print to this printer, you can choose to write the output to any of the supported image formats. SoftCopy is truly an all-in-one virtual printer driver that supports multiple image formats within one product. Unlike most of our competitors, there is no need to install a new driver for each additional image format. You decide which image format you wish to write to at the point of final output.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:987c634f513a89e011f37660daf0d7fd9709be28","amp;dn":"SoftCopy+v2.01","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"987c634f513a89e011f37660daf0d7fd9709be28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,124,99,79,81,58,137,224,17,243,118,96,218,240,215,253,151,9,190,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
