Extreme configurable, performance and a top-notch user and developer community are all hallmarks of the Gentoo experience.\n\nThanks to a technology called Portage, Gentoo can become an ideal secure server, development workstation, professional desktop, gaming system, embedded solution or something else -- whatever you need it to be. Because of its near-unlimited adaptability, we call Gentoo a meta distribution.\n\nOf course, Gentoo is more than just the software it provides. It is a community built around a distribution which is driven by more than 300 developers and thousands of users. The distribution project provides the means for the users to enjoy Gentoo: documentation, infrastructure (mailing lists, site, forums ...), release engineering, software porting, quality assurance, security follow up, hardening and more.
