It was directed by Mathew Cullen of production company Motion Theory. EastEnders\n\nIt features two views of this: one the real-world view in which the occupants of the car are lying motionless on the pavement following the accident, and the other (during the choruses) in which the camera shows them from above.\n\nIn the second view, the couple &amp;#039;come to life&amp;#039; and move as if standing up. The couple appear to reenact their relationship, from first meeting and the initial joy, then the despair caused by the woman having another lover, then forgiveness and rekindling the passion again before the accident. The music video finally ends with both being shown on stretchers, being wheeled away in different directions by ambulance crews tending to them.\n\nAdele is not one of the car crash victims; instead she is an onlooker.\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bffb3268bbc72c4a7773484350394aac6c449fb5","amp;dn":"Adele+-+Chasing+Pavements","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bffb3268bbc72c4a7773484350394aac6c449fb5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,251,50,104,187,199,44,74,119,115,72,67,80,57,74,172,108,68,159,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
