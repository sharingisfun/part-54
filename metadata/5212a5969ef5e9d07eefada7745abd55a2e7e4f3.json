Though musically they differ from their more chaotic children, thematically it&amp;#039;s all here. Mercyful Fate features King Diamond and his trademark chipmunk-getting-kicked-in-the-balls-high vocals and the criminally underrated Denner/Shermann guitar duo. Actually you can compare Mercyful Fate with Judas Priest: Both being Metal pioneers (Speed (JP) and Black (MF)); Have singers with high-as-fuck vox; and an extremely talented guitar duo.\n\nSo on to the music. This album is classic Metal heaven (hell?). From the opening riff to the AAAAAAH before the verse in &quot;Evil&quot;, you pretty much know they kick ass. Yet there is a certain hilarity in the fact that the band sings about Satan and other occult claptrap with a singer like...well you know. Throughout the album they play solid songs such as &quot;Into The Coven&quot;, &quot;Black Funeral&quot;, the epic length &quot;Satan&amp;#039;s Fall&quot;, hell the whole damn album is essential listening. Except maybe the ballad &quot;Melissa&quot; that one never gelled with me and I don&amp;#039;t think it&amp;#039;s as good as everyone says, but hey that&amp;#039;s just me.\n\nAs usual 320kbps rip, straight off CD (the remaster one)\n\nBUY THIS ALBUM OR KING DIAMOND&amp;#039;S HIGH VOICE WILL SHATTER YOUR MIND!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5212a5969ef5e9d07eefada7745abd55a2e7e4f3","amp;dn":"METAL+CLASSIC%3A+Mercyful+Fate+%5C%22Melissa%5C%22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5212a5969ef5e9d07eefada7745abd55a2e7e4f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,18,165,150,158,245,233,208,126,239,173,167,116,90,189,85,162,231,228,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
