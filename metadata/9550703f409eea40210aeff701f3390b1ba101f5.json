Malmsteen's innovative guitar style made \nRising Force a mandatory primer for '80s metal guitarists, with its classical \nchord progressions and Malmsteen's use of harmonic minor scales, a wide vibrato \nimitative of classical violinists, and impossibly fast picking techniques, \nincluding the sweep-picked arpeggio (sort of a cross between strumming a chord \nand picking each note individually). Malmsteen's obsessions with Bach, Beethoven, \nand Paganini are used in the service of a dark, stately, gothic atmosphere and \nsent guitar students scurrying to learn their works as well as Malmsteen's own. \nThe true inauguration of the age of the guitar shredder. ~ Steve Huey, All Music \nGuide \n \n\nJeff Scott Soto Vocals  \nBarriemore Barlow Drums  \nJens Johansson Keyboards\nYngwie Malmsteen Guitar (Bass), Guitar (Electric), Bass Pedals, Guitar (Acoustic), Guitar  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9550703f409eea40210aeff701f3390b1ba101f5","amp;dn":"Yngwie+Malmsteen+-+Rising+Force","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9550703f409eea40210aeff701f3390b1ba101f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,80,112,63,64,158,234,64,33,10,239,247,1,243,57,11,27,161,1,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
