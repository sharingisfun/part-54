There is now a much smoother and faster way to create setup files for easy installation of applications. As a developer, you will no longer be bogged down learning complex installation programs or yet another awkward scripting language. This guarantees hassle-free programming, quicker market delivery and ultimately a faster turnaround with more satisfied users. Smart Install Maker enables the creation of a professional-looking, custom-made setup file in just a few mouse clicks. The simplicity of Smart Install Maker means:\n\nNo Scripts \nNo brain twisters \nNo unreasonable charges \n\n\nMore infos at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sminstall.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sminstall.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe Package contains a first version of the program made portable w/ the batch file that launches the program converted to an EXE with QBFC to avoid showing the relative DOS window, but that some AVs see sometimes as a virus. If your AV is one of them, or if you don&amp;#039;t trust too much to it, use the second one that runs directly the batch file. You will have the sloppy DOS window in the background but less complaints from antiviruses...\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:136b759a7bc10addeb3126973477ffbec95c948a","amp;dn":"Smart+Install+Maker+v5.02+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"136b759a7bc10addeb3126973477ffbec95c948a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,107,117,154,123,193,10,221,235,49,38,151,52,119,255,190,201,92,148,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
