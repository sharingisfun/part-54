His teen daughter Jenny has fallen in with the English beatnik scene and likes to hang out in cave-like clubs to listen to jazz and rudimentary rock\\&amp;#039;n\\&amp;#039;roll. Jenny takes an immediate dislike to her mother-in-law, who is not that much older than she, and goes out of her way to make life miserable for Nichole. When Jenny discovers that Nichole is a friend of one of the strippers from the dance hall across the street, she investigates and uses Nichole\\&amp;#039;s sordid past to embarrass her father. Meanwhile Jenny attracts the lecherous eye of Kenny, the owner of the dance hall.\n\n(written by Ed Sutton)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcd57aab12c73ec9bc0860304520b2b4a674c3c4","amp;dn":"Beat+Girl+-+Noelle+Adam+%281960%29.wmv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcd57aab12c73ec9bc0860304520b2b4a674c3c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,213,122,171,18,199,62,201,188,8,96,48,69,32,178,180,166,116,195,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
