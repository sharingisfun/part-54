Hard boiled, sleazy and rough!\nTarantino is currently working on a remake...\n\nSet in Europe during WWII, a group of American soldiers are in the process of being shipped off to military prison for a variety of infractions, ranging from desertion to murder. While they&amp;#039;re being transported, a German artillery attack hits the convoy, killing the MPs and enabling four of the prisoners to escape. The group decides their best bet is to head to neutral Switzerland where they can avoid the fighting and prison. As they make their way to what they think will be freedom, they end up volunteering for a commando mission to steal a V2 warhead for the French Underground. Somehow, the team must sneak into the most heavily guarded base in German territory, steal the Nazi&amp;#039;s most precious military hardware, and bring it back to the allies without getting arrested again by their own side\n\nThis is disc 1 of the Swedish 2-disc uncut edition.
