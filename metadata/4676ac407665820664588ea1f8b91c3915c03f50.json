Dvd rip. English subs only. Ep 1-3 is the 3 part motion picture Attack of the Cylons (Saga of a Star World). Ep 4 is the first part of The lost planet of the gods. \n\nThe Original DVD is a whopping 7.8gig, so had to cut down on quality quite a bit to get it down to 4.7. There wasn't much extras to remove either. Shrinking done with DVD Shrink. Quality still ok considering is wasn't crystal clear to being with (don't think they had much of THX and Digitalization back in 1980.... :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4676ac407665820664588ea1f8b91c3915c03f50","amp;dn":"Battlestar+Galactica+-+Original+Series+1980+-+episodes+1-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4676ac407665820664588ea1f8b91c3915c03f50","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,118,172,64,118,101,130,6,100,88,142,161,248,185,28,57,21,192,63,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
