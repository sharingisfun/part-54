In the year 1914, Lieutenant Colonel Luang Gat Yuthakarn was one of three Thais sent to learn flying at the Flying Training School in France. Upon his return, the Flying Division was established in Siam making it the first country in Asia to have a aviation program. Luang Gat encountered many obstacles in this effort, not the least of which was the resistance from members of the Royal family who thought it was nonsense. Luang Gat persevered. First, he had to train his own pilots with the help of Pierre Pupong, his friend and former flight instructor from France. His students were five commissioned officers and one non-commissioned officer. The non-commissioned officer is a farm boy. Someone from such humble origins would normally never have a chance to be a pilot, but FIRST FLIGHT is a film about the &quot;Power of a Dream.&quot; It is about Luang Gat&amp;#039;s dream to have an aviation program in Siam. It is about Duang&amp;#039;s dream to fly, and it is about a meeting of two cultures. The aircraft and Pierre come from the West, and Siam is in the East. Through the four months of hard training and the interaction of these flying cadets, we learn about Thai culture and the challenges of early aviators.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c308780da9d60d55a583af2456e49dd3bddd2406","amp;dn":"First+flight+%5BTHAI-DVD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c308780da9d60d55a583af2456e49dd3bddd2406","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,8,120,13,169,214,13,85,165,131,175,36,86,228,157,211,189,221,36,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
