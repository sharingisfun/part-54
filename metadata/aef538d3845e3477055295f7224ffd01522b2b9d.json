Between sacred and profane. Between society and solitude pave their way Tribes of the City from Riga. \n\nTribes of the City are six musicians coming from different backgrounds and carrying different world views, yet by holding together they manage to create a sensational sounding, which carries the listener away to their imaginary world. \n\nTheir latest album called \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;for the sleepy people\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; is created in close co-operation with British sound producer Greg Haver, who is known by his work with such bands as Manic Street Preachers, Super Furry Animals and Catatonia. \n\n\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;for the sleepy people\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; is the second album in band\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s discography. Their first record - \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Running to the Sun\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; was produced in Denmark in 2004. Back then Baltic musical press already called it \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;European-scale event\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;. \n\nOne can find in their music the rumbling of sea and noise of the city, murmur of the forest and crackle of electricity. People refer to them as modern shoegazers and mention the special energy of their live performances.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://vip.tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://vip.tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce&lt;/a&gt;\nudp://vip.tracker.thepiratebay.se:80/announce","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aef538d3845e3477055295f7224ffd01522b2b9d","amp;dn":"Shoegaze+by+Tribes+of+the+city","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aef538d3845e3477055295f7224ffd01522b2b9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,245,56,211,132,94,52,119,5,82,149,247,34,79,253,1,82,43,43,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
