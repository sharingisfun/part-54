It came out of a remix for a Frontrunner song, Machine Age, then infinite experimentation possibilities were born. Feeling at home with the most distorted sounds, then came the idea of creating more music, where the proposal is getting the closest possible to a machine-like sound. Hence the outfit name. Thus releasing complex and experimental music with frequent rhythmic variations, movie samples, dark basslines, deep ambiences created by keyboards, diverse noises are constant elements. Creating an unlimited sound trying to get away from the tedious repetition of some genres. Adding elements of EBM/Industrial/Noise and even softer styles such as synth pop and ambient. We reached an unique and unlabelled sound named: A Industrya \n\nLabel: Metropolis Project Recs.  \nCountry: Brazil \nReleased: 2006\nGenre: Electronic  \nStyle: EBM, Techno, Experimental, Industrial, Electro\nQuality: MP3 128 kbps\n\n*Free tracks from band website.\n\nTracklist:\n01-zona_lost\n02-blood_or_oil?\n03-underground_lab\n04-amplintruder\n05-reprojection\n06-transmutation\n07-assembler_code\n08-carcere_noturno\n09-aliance_angst\n10-automation_overide\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8556a4d526c9a55f88408a37d0fb5e6cda596c0e","amp;dn":"A+INDUSTRYA+-+A+Industrya%3A+Best+Of+EBM+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8556a4d526c9a55f88408a37d0fb5e6cda596c0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,86,164,213,38,201,165,95,136,64,138,55,208,251,94,108,218,89,108,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
