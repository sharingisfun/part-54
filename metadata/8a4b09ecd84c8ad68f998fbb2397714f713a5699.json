The early styles of the trovadores (troubadours), mixing inspiration as diverse as street peasant songs and 19th-century Spanish and French classical styles (here in the light orchestrations of several tracks), have produced many beautiful songs still remembered to this day. On this CD they are presented by some of the original practitioners, from 50 to 97 years old, who searched their notebooks for melodic scraps and self-composed tunes, piecing together an unabashedly nostalgic and romantic re-creation of their glory days, their vigor and playfulness undiminished. These 14 cuts comprise a document unlike any other on Cuban music. --Derek Rath\n\nCasa de la Trova is the place in Santiago de Cuba were everything began. Trova tradicional, as it is known in Cuba, is the precursor genre for all the music that made it big in Havana, including Buena Vista Social Club. BVSC's Eliades Ochoa used to play there.\n \n\nFiles:\n01- Flor De Venganza.mp3\n02- Rosalba.mp3\n03- Cajon Del Muerto.mp3\n04- Ella Y Yo.mp3\n05- Si Fuera Como Tu.mp3\n06- A Herminia.mp3\n07- El Ministerio De Tus Ojos.mp3\n08- Y Tu Que Has Hecho .mp3\n09- A Una Coqueta.mp3\n10- Tarde Dominical.mp3\n11- A La Orilla Del Mar.mp3\n12- Sublime Ilusion.mp3\n13- Entre Flores Morire.mp3\n14- Si Volvieras A Mi.mp3\nCasa de la Trova (front).jpg\nrelease-notes.nfo\ntracks-credits.txt\n\nFull credits.
