One Love is 20 cuts to Legend's 16, a set that plays in chronological order of release as opposed to party mix. As with the latter, One Love presents the sweet organ-driven and feedback-scarred live version of &amp;quot;No Woman, No Cry&amp;quot; as well as album versions of classics like &amp;quot;I Shot the Sheriff,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Get Up, Stand Up,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Jamming.&amp;quot; Single versions of &amp;quot;Buffalo Soldier&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Exodus&amp;quot; sidle up to the full-band cut of &amp;quot;Redemption Song&amp;quot; and the soulful Marley/Curtis Mayfield medley, &amp;quot;One Love/People Get Ready.&amp;quot; A fine sampler of the Tuff Gong years from 1972's Catch a Fire and onward, One Love is aimed at the casual Marley fan rather than the hardcore completist, though its final track is indeed a rarity: the Marley-penned, Lee &amp;quot;Scratch&amp;quot; Perry-produced &amp;quot;I Know a Place.&amp;quot; A moving ballad-styled anthem of solidarity and freedom, it was recorded in 1977 and is unavailable on any other Bob Marley &amp;amp; the Wailers album. One Love gives clear evidence of why Marley's legacy endears and endures nearly a generation after his passing.
