Lovely Swedish actress Helena Mattsson is the girl with the genes from outer space this time ? she&amp;#039;s a college professor suffering from blackouts who discovers that the source of her illness is the result of her scientist uncle (Ben Cross, lending a serious note to the proceedings), who created her from a mix of human DNA and the same alien soup that gave life to Syl (Natasha Henstridge, who does not appear in this film) from the first Species. From there, the pair head to Mexico to stop the rapid decline of Miranda&amp;#039;s health; the cure, however, unleashes her voracious extraterrestrial side, which stops at nothing to find a partner for procreation. Budgetary issues are the main downfall of The Awakening ? the basic premise delivers what the Species series promises, but both script and special effects are undercooked to the point of confusion and/or laughter. However, viewers who expect nothing more than the B-movie thrills of Species 3 should be amused by this picture&amp;#039;s low-watt sex and violence.\n\nCast \nHelena Mattsson\nBen Cross \nMarco Bacuzzi \nCynthia Francesconi \nJulian Sedgwick \n\n\nGenre Horror/Sci-Fi\nLanguage English\nOriginal Source Species The Awakening 2007 DVDSCR XviD-VoMiT\nTracker Bandit\nVideo MPEG1/NTSC/352x240/29.97fps\nAudio 44.1kHz/192kbps/Stereo\nSize of Bin file 806 MB\nChapters Every 5 mins\n\nI always Burn all of my movies before i Upload...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:425fdf5b7026ac27da6e40bf372871ed34ce616b","amp;dn":"Species+The+Awakening+2007+DVDSCR-VoMiT+%28A+Kingdom+KVCD+By+Pccon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"425fdf5b7026ac27da6e40bf372871ed34ce616b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,95,223,91,112,38,172,39,218,110,64,191,55,40,113,237,52,206,97,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
