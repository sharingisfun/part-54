They then picked up their jars of moonshine again. The band has been driven by singer Robby Gira?s songwriting talents, combined with the arranging input and versatility of Trevor Mulvey, Aki Iwata, and Ryan Fox.\n\nCactus is most known for the variety of musical styles that are incorporated into the original old country concept of the music. This is mostly due to the different musical backgrounds the members come from; Trevor has studied jazz, country, latin jazz and folk in school and from private teachers, Ryan and Aki are currently studying classical music at Cal State Fullerton (Ryan-voice, Aki-guitar), and Robby gathers influence from everything he listens to.\n\nThis unique blend of influences is captured in every cactus song and performance.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thesixtyone.com/cactusbobband/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thesixtyone.com/cactusbobband/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdf080c824eb93545a4468d2a70a0aa1fad093ba","amp;dn":"Cactus+Bob+-+Cactus+Bob","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdf080c824eb93545a4468d2a70a0aa1fad093ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,240,128,200,36,235,147,84,90,68,104,210,167,10,10,161,250,208,147,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
