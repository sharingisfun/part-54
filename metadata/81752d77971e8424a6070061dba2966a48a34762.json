Need to move songs from one computer      \n    to another? Lost all your iTunes music due to a computer failure?     \n    iPod Access is the answer. Unlike some other iPod applications on     \n    the market today iPod Access utilizes the iPod database to display    \n    song information. Using this database enables song listings to be     \n    displayed instantly, playlist data to be viewed, and songs            \n    purchased from the iTunes Music Store to be displayed properly.       \n    Version 2 also added Playlist Cloning and the ability to add songs    \n    directly into iTunes.                                                 \n                                                                          \n    With a simplified user interface including song filtering by          \n    Artist/Album or Composer/Album you can find the songs you need to     \n    copy and even listen to them directly in the main window. When        \n    copying songs iPod Access can organize songs into Artist/Album        \n    folders or Composer/Album folders and change the file names if        \n    desired. iPod Access also provides one button full sequential         \n    music backups. By pressing &quot;Backup&quot; in the toolbar you can speed      \n    up the process of regular backups. iPod Access will by default        \n    only copy new songs added to your iPod so you don&amp;#039;t have to           \n    remember what you have added.
