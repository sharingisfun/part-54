He is the one who made Wallace and Gromit and Chicken Run. Anyway, he also made 2 great movies about how animals live in the zoo's. Interviewing them about their view of life and such. It's very funny.\n1 from 1990 and 1 from 2003. I'm seeding both here. THIS one is a collection of different animations also worth having if u like his other stuff.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e61d833c2d8d1be2fcf8838274064eb56174f1db","amp;dn":"Nick+Park+-+Different+Animations","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e61d833c2d8d1be2fcf8838274064eb56174f1db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,29,131,60,45,141,27,226,252,248,131,130,116,6,78,181,97,116,241,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
