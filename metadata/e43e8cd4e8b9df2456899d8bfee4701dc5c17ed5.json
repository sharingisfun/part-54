This is the updated version of JeppView Date Calc.exe v1.1a 28feb08.\nNow standalone with setup and instructions in several JPG files (like slideshow). The source code in VB6 is included for those of you who would like to enhance it further! Tested ok XP and Vista.\nFSallATP\n\n\nUPDATE 08 Jan 2010  ---------  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\nmost of your questions are already answered in this or similar posts (try search with jepp*) in this site.\nthe new info is cause Jeppesen has upgraded security, for new installation, change first your computer clock to 31-12-2008 and use cycle 01 of 2009 so the R00D-KCAB can be validated without problems (validation code through phone) then run the program so it will alter the registry settings. Then close the program, change time and reboot. Now you can use any of the recent codes, 25 or 26 of 2009, 01 of 2010 etc. without problems ! \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e43e8cd4e8b9df2456899d8bfee4701dc5c17ed5","amp;dn":"JeppView+3+Date+Calc+v1.1a+%2B+instructions+%2B+more","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e43e8cd4e8b9df2456899d8bfee4701dc5c17ed5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,62,140,212,232,185,223,36,86,137,157,139,254,228,112,29,197,193,126,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
