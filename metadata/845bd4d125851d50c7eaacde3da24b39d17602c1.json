Diversity is the key word to describe the unique music style and sound of the band. Saltriver was formed by musicians that knew each other from previous projects; Ivan Gatev ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? vocals ,Peter Iliev ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? guitar , Emerih Ambil ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? guitar ,Smilen Slavshtenski ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? bass and ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??MoziÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? on drums were the founding members of Saltriver in the autumn of 2005. The band recorded four songs in the spring of 2006: ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??9ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? ,ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??Bitter half of meÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? ,ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??NightmanÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? ,ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??HeyÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? (the last  two entered the Pulserated.com playlist and ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??Nightman stayed in the top 40 chart for eight months reaching number 2).Shortly after that ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??MoziÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? left the band and they struggled to find a drummer for a while. That led to missing some good opportunities and slowing down some recording sessions. Saltriver found a replacement drummer for the ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??Tangra Mega LiveÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? festival and that was their only show in the summer of 2006.As it turned out this was for a reason because the band found the perfect drummer for them in the face of Teodor Obretenov ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??ToshoÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??. He joined the band in the autumn of 2006 and his debut gig with Saltriver actually was their first birthday show in a Sofia club. With their new drummer Saltriver recorded three songs in the end of 2006: ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??Wicked MindÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??, ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??WhyÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? and a new version of ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??9ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??. Things started to look up for Saltriver but they still needed the heavy airplay in the local radios necessary for a young band to make it. That came with recording the ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??Mr. ScarecrowÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? EP (Mr. Scarecrow, Meaningless ,TimeÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??s Square) with the title song becoming a hit for the alternative rock fans and ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??MeaninglessÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? always a live show favourite. Actually it was SaltriverÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??s live performances that generated fans interest at the beginning. Exhaustingly long and energetic their stage acts leave no one standing. In the autumn of 2007 the band recorded two new songs - ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??What I NeedÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? and what would later be the title of their first album ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??Tombstone without a nameÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??. Saltriver decided that it was time for their first album so the songs that they recorded for little less than two years all got to be in it. Because of financial difficulties the album is not yet properly released but that didnÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??t stop the band from playing live. The concert schedule got thicker and Saltriver became one of the most demanded bands in the clubs of Sofia. In the begging of 2008 the video for ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??MeaninglessÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? was finished and Saltriver were no longer only a radio band. With a few interviews on national television more and more people started talking about Saltriver. But in spite of all the good reviews that their shows got the band was still struggling to find its sound in the studio. So many of their critics were silent when in the on the 9th of April 2008 Saltriver released the ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢??Next Bus To HeavenÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢?? EP (Next Bus To Heaven , Smith , Neverlanded). \nRight now the band is concentrated on creating some new songs and of course promoting the old ones live.   \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:845bd4d125851d50c7eaacde3da24b39d17602c1","amp;dn":"Saltriver+%28single+colection%29+-+last.fm+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"845bd4d125851d50c7eaacde3da24b39d17602c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,91,212,209,37,133,29,80,199,234,172,222,61,162,75,57,209,118,2,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
