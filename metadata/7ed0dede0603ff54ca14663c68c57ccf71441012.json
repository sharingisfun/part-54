In other words, they were making up/inventing most of the terrorists you would have seen on TV in the last few years.\n\nAlso, discover why DONALD RUMSFELD is now by international law considered a criminal for committing crimes of war, has an arrest warrant on his head and would be placed under arrest and thrown in jail if he ever steps foot into Germany and certain other places in Europe.\n\nThis documentary is not biased and tells the complete truth, unlike many other documentaries out there.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nAlso check out...\nWar Made Easy - How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us To Death  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3789936/War_Made_Easy_-_How_Presidents_and_Pundits_Keep_Spinning_Us_To_D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3789936/War_Made_Easy_-_How_Presidents_and_Pundits_Keep_Spinning_Us_To_D&lt;/a&gt;\t\t\n\nAlso check out...\nHijacking Catastrophe (2004.DVDRip) - How the American Government tactically used the events of 911 to systematically manipulate the people into supporting the war &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4164002/Hijacking_Catastrophe_2004_DVDRip&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4164002/Hijacking_Catastrophe_2004_DVDRip&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ed0dede0603ff54ca14663c68c57ccf71441012","amp;dn":"Rendition.The.True.Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ed0dede0603ff54ca14663c68c57ccf71441012","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,208,222,222,6,3,255,84,202,20,102,60,104,197,124,207,113,68,16,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
