It is ideal for anyone who wants to listen to articles while travelling, exercising or just relaxing.\n\nI have also noticed they have got a new speaker for the economist last week, not as good as some of the others in my opinion but still not bad.\n\nEnjoy your weekly routine people!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8b0b04d409112defdc3209ab635179b4e34c962","amp;dn":"The+Economist+July+5th+-+July+11th+2008.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8b0b04d409112defdc3209ab635179b4e34c962","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,176,176,77,64,145,18,222,253,195,32,154,182,53,23,155,78,52,201,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
