The album opens with a breathing, dirge-like piece, followed by one with more of a gypsy feel. &quot;Wave Hill&quot; is peaceful, with an overlapping, repeating melody -- a seeming precursor to a tune Klucevsek would later play on Dave Douglas&amp;#039; Charms of the Night Sky, &quot;Sea Change.&quot; The next piece, &quot;Tesknota,&quot; written in memory of John Cage, is beautiful and meditative, with erhu-like string work and introspective slides and drones. The mood and pace lift considerably for the title track, and the closing piece features a string whistle call-and-response across a lake of accordion. Filled with beautiful instrumentals -- except for the unnecessary, goofball song &quot;Donut Ask, Donut Tell&quot; -- Klucevsek&amp;#039;s Stolen Memories is a strong offering from a premier music maker.\n\n1 \tRumbling \tMarks \t2:53\n2 \tThe Gunks \tMarks \t2:44\n3 \tUrban Rite \tKlucevsek \t2:55\n4 \tWave Hill \tMarks \t6:18\n5 \tTesknota \tKlucevsek \t14:12\n6 \tStolen Memories \tKlucevsek, Traditional \t5:35\n7 \tDonut Ask, Donut Tell \tKlucevsek \t3:05\n8 \tRegunkitation \tMarks \t2:00\n9 \tSkating on Thin Air \tMarks \t2:51","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:508974d36f5ef0d94d2096ee6344db22f541880f","amp;dn":"Guy+Klucevsek+-+Stolen+Memories","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"508974d36f5ef0d94d2096ee6344db22f541880f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,137,116,211,111,94,240,217,77,32,150,238,99,68,219,34,245,65,136,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
