Aside from a misfired cover of the \nBeatles' &amp;quot;Ticket to Ride,&amp;quot; Webb wrote everything on this album, which -- with \nbetween-track segues, lyrics expounding dreams and possibility, and dense \norchestral settings -- seemed to be aiming for a song cycle of sorts. It's not \nPet Sounds, however, or even Van Dyke Parks' Song Cycle. It's overambitious \nMOR pop-soul with mild psychedelic colors, and a bit ludicrous, though not \nunattractive due to the typically conscientious harmonies. &amp;quot;Orange Air&amp;quot; is \nprobably the group's best shot at pseudo-psychedelia; &amp;quot;The Girls' Song,&amp;quot; on \nmuch firmer MOR territory, was done much better by Jackie DeShannon; and \n&amp;quot;The Worst That Could Happen,&amp;quot; Webb at his most disagreeably sentimental, \nwas covered for a huge hit by the Brooklyn Bridge about a year later. A recent\n biography of cult singer/songwriter Nick Drake, by the way, revealed that this\n album, along with such estimable underground classics as Love's Forever \nChanges and Van Morrison's Astral Weeks, was a special favorite of his \nbecause of its combination of rock and orchestration. That means it might \nsuddenly become a lot harder to find in the dollar bins, although many of \nthose copies will probably find their way right back there after Drake fans play\n it once or twice. [The album was also reissued by Soul City under the title The\n Worst That Could Happen.]\n\nenjoy and seed :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6ce0fe6fa1f187c90795c41d0aa602f96de26bf","amp;dn":"5th+Dimension+-+Magic+Garden+%28Soul-1967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6ce0fe6fa1f187c90795c41d0aa602f96de26bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,206,15,230,250,31,24,124,144,121,92,65,208,170,96,47,150,222,38,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
