I will make another try in maybe a month from now at best with a new album. I'm sorry, but the only one you can blame is probably yourself.\n\n\n\n\n\nFLAC - Free Lossless Audio Compression\nhttp://flac.sf.net\nNote that this is NOT compressed and ruined mp3 files.

On this 11-track masterpiece, so full of adrenaline and swarming moods, ATDI has created one of the most infecting and mind-blowing rock albums in a long time. While most of the tracks are of the more aggressive edge, this is undeniably the band's most focused and well put together and, therefore, best all-around album yet. &amp;quot;Quarantined&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Sleepwalk Capsules&amp;quot; alone make this album worth purchasing: This music is seamless and inspiring. Electronic movements meshed into &amp;quot;Enfilade&amp;quot; stretch the texture of the album further, into the unique backup vocals of Iggy Pop on &amp;quot;Rolodex Propaganda.&amp;quot; Amidst all the rock, there is the undeniably unique edge about ATDI's sound, something that has permeated through their music from the Hell Paso 7&amp;quot;. Beautiful vocals bursting passion in quirky, abstract, and often thrilling lyrics, youthful energy, driving melodies, and a sense of beyond-the-moment urgency. Moving from Relentless to Grand Royal, as well as to the notorious and mostly infamous producer Ross Robinson, has not killed the band's spirit or sound, as many loyal fans feared it would in the pattern of Jawbreaker, Jawbox, among others. If anything, it has allowed the band to push themselves to new limits, to fulfill what they have been working for relentlessly for so long. This is not a band that could ever be insincere. You can see it in their eyes and feel it in their music and work ethic. ATDI is one of the saviors of true emotional straight-up rock! \n \n\n\nTracks \n\n1  Arcarsenal  At the Drive In  2:55  \n2  Pattern Against User  At The Drive In  3:17  \n3  One Armed Scissor  At The Drive In  4:19  \n4  Sleepwalk Capsules  At The Drive In  3:27  \n5  Invalid Litter Dept.
