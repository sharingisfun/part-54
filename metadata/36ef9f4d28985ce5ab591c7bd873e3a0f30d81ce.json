This project was started for Dynamism for the GP2X community, but its userbase far exceeds its original design. andLinux is free and will remain so, but donations are greatly needed.\n\nandLinux uses CoLinux as its core which is confusing for many people. CoLinux is a port of the Linux kernel to Windows. Although this technology is like VMware or Virtual PC, CoLinux differs itself by being more of a merger of Windows and the Linux kernel and not an emulated PC, making it more efficient. Xming is used as X server and PulseAudio as sound server.\n\nandLinux is not just for development and runs almost all Linux applications without modification","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36ef9f4d28985ce5ab591c7bd873e3a0f30d81ce","amp;dn":"andlinux-beta1rc6-kde.exe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36ef9f4d28985ce5ab591c7bd873e3a0f30d81ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,239,159,77,40,152,92,229,171,89,28,123,216,115,227,160,243,13,129,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
