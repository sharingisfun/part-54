His fame, and record sales there (as well as in PerÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Âº, where he also appeared on the major TV network, and sang on at least one occasion, at the special request of a member of the Peruvian oligarchy for a 16th birthday celebration), were certainly noteworthy, even exceeding those of his idol, Elvis Presley.\n\nThis particular &quot;achievement&quot;, translated by his biographers as Reed being the &quot;Red Elvis&quot;, or as being more popular and a hotter record seller both in South America and behind the Iron Curtain than Elvis Presley, but without the specific mention of the latter being his idol-which helps to better put into perspective what that actually meant in terms of achievement, for Reed or for his fans-is somewhat misleading as there were, in addition to Reed, many other singers, local and foreign who were more popular than Presley was, even at his peak, in these two markets.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8a07e440679525bff4be30ecd187acc7d7df0ff","amp;dn":"The+Red+Elvis+%28Der+Rote+Elvis%29+-+Dean+Reed+documentary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8a07e440679525bff4be30ecd187acc7d7df0ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,160,126,68,6,121,82,91,255,75,227,14,205,24,122,204,125,125,240,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
