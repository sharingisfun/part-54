Well, PDA Toolbox may be just the tool you are looking for. It allows you to create simple database-driven Palm applications without any programming at all.\n\nPDA Toolbox is quite easy to learn if you are willing to put a bit of time into it. I created my first app in less than an hour. The process is relatively simple. You just create a form, add some fields to it, then add some buttons with predefined actions like &quot;Move to Next Entry&quot;. You don&amp;#039;t even have to worry about setting up a database; one is created for you automatically. There is an extensive seventeen-page tutorial on the PDA Toolbox Web site that, step by step, walks you through the process of creating a practice application.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:822a7eb56f448f3ffab371db22b5ac037c267169","amp;dn":"PDAT6.5.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"822a7eb56f448f3ffab371db22b5ac037c267169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,42,126,181,111,68,143,63,250,179,113,219,34,181,172,3,124,38,113,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
