A MAN LIKE ME\n\n* there is a drop on the original tape at a certain point of the song.\n+ last minute of the song sound get a little weird.\n@ beginning of the song is missing\n\nPlease do not expect a great sound quality from this, is it\njust a discreet audience recording that i cleaned a little bit,\nbut on the other side expect a marvelous performance, reaching\nhis peak on the 14 minutes of &quot;the war goes on&quot;, a psychedelic\norgy with eastern vibes. From my point of view i consider the\nMad River one of the top bands of the californian psychedelic era,\nand their 2 lp's are, absolutely, 2 masterpieces, as the solo lp's\nfrom their leader Lawrence Hammond. Since i never found anything\nelse beside this tape in years of searching, and i still hope this tape\nand others will surface one day in better quality, i would like to\nshare this gem i have, even if the sound quality is it just ok, but\nlike i said, the performance is an unique document that testify the\ngreatness of this super underrated band. If you can deal with a\nminor sound quality compare to the standard, my advice is jump on it.\n\n1st generation tape &gt; equalizer &gt; cd &gt; eac &gt; wav &gt; flac\nwww.dimeadozen.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aced4dbc6d4ae251ee1d856c32b00797381fffa","amp;dn":"west+coast+psych+%3A+Mad+River+-+live+and+demos+-+1966%2F1967","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aced4dbc6d4ae251ee1d856c32b00797381fffa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,206,212,219,198,212,174,37,30,225,216,86,195,43,0,121,115,129,255,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
