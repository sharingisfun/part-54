Francisco\n2. Just For Now\n3. Don&amp;#039;t Blame Me\n4. Condition Blue\n5. Capuchin Swing\n6. On The Lion\n\n\n\nLong available only as a Japanese Import, Capuchin Swing has just been remastered by Blue Note in glorious 24-bit sound. Initially recorded in 1960, early in McLean&amp;#039;s Blue Note period, the sessions featured McLean on alto sax, Blue Mitchell on trumpet, Walter Bishop Jr. on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Art Taylor on drums. Great band, great songs, great results.\nFive of the six numbers are originals written by either McLean or Bishop, displaying superb craftsmanship, purity of imagination, and wonderful interplay between the musicians. My favorite song is &quot;Francisco,&quot; a scorching piece with a bit of a Latin tinge.\nMcLean is simply fabulous from start to finish. Throughout his career McLean has always had a plethora of outstanding musical ideas, technique to burn, and the ability to communicate with intensity and passion. Capuchin Swing is no exception. Add to this mix the fiery Blue Mitchell and a great rhythm section, and the result is one of Blue Note&amp;#039;s classic recordings. Get it while you can.\n\n(Review by Ron Saranich)\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af20cdbd3fb71924b3499b2eae93c4dd6e6e7b9a","amp;dn":"Jackie+McLean+-+Capuchin+Swing%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af20cdbd3fb71924b3499b2eae93c4dd6e6e7b9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,32,205,189,63,183,25,36,179,73,155,46,174,147,196,221,110,110,123,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
