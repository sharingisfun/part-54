I remember my dad bumpin&amp;#039; this stuff in the living room and my brother and I would have breakdancing battles. Man, I miss those days.....\n\nAnyway, enough babbling, Big Apple Rappin&amp;#039;: The Early Days Of Hip Hop Culture In NYC is a must have for anyone that doesn&amp;#039;t have these tracks. I have a lot of this material in crates (thanks dad!), but I had to buy two copies of this so I could wear one out and preserve the other. Classics like &quot;Funkbox Party&quot;, &quot;Spoonin&amp;#039; Rap&quot;, &quot;How We Gonna Make The Black Nation Rise&quot;, and &quot;Catch The Beat&quot; make this a must have already, but then there are obscure joints like &quot;Fly Guy Rap&quot;, &quot;Rock The Beat&quot;, and rarities like &quot;Get The Party Jumpin&amp;#039;&quot; and &quot;Weekend&quot; that make the asking price seem like it&amp;#039;s not so bad. Then again, I take that back. Which brings me to my next point...\n\nMy beef isn&amp;#039;t with the material on the album, but the asking price. I saw this same CD in a few stores retailing at over $40. I can see why the asking price is so high, but that seems a little steep for only 16 tracks. Also, Amazon lists the tracks as 16 straight cuts, but my copy comes with two 8 song CDs. But every song on here is a timeless piece of hip hop history.\n\nBig Apple Rappin&amp;#039; is an excellent compilation. If you&amp;#039;re a DJ like I am and you don&amp;#039;t have these cuts (though you probably do already), then you should grab this. You could find these songs on other compilations and albums, but I found that the re-mastering of these songs were done exceptionally well on these discs. It&amp;#039;s becoming increasingly hard to find early 70&amp;#039;s rap anyway, so I definitely recommend grabbing this if you have the $40 to burn.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af41d5d04ddb9ef72220df87b922fce898a9ff9a","amp;dn":"Big+Apple+Rappin%5C%27_+The+Early+Days+Of+Hip+Hop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af41d5d04ddb9ef72220df87b922fce898a9ff9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,65,213,208,77,219,158,247,34,32,223,135,185,34,252,232,152,169,255,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
