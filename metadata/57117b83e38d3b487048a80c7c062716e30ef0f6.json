Although presented as a separate film, and sometimes shown independently, it could also be regarded as a prologue to the longer film, which is almost never shown without The Crimson Permanent Assurance preceding it....&quot;\nfrom: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crimson_Permanent_Assurance&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Crimson_Permanent_Assurance&lt;/a&gt;\n**************************************************************************\nI created this torrent because I found an iPod version of the rest of the movie online, but not this movie short.  Without seeing this short movie first, there is one major part of The Meaning of Life that will make no sense at all...\n\nThis was converted to iPod format with MPEG Streamclip from an Aavi file.  English, no subtitles...\nThis torrent DOES NOT contain the entire movie of The Meaning of Life, only the first sixteen minute long flim short that traditionally precedes it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57117b83e38d3b487048a80c7c062716e30ef0f6","amp;dn":"Monty+Python%60s+The+Meaning+Of+Life+%281%29.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57117b83e38d3b487048a80c7c062716e30ef0f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,17,123,131,227,141,59,72,112,72,168,12,124,6,39,22,227,14,240,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
