It contains \n             a tour diary, interviews with John Petrucci and Jordan \n             Ruddess in which they show some of their equipment, \n             a drum solo by Mike Potrnoy and the 2004 tour opening \n             video.  \n\n             \n\n             Note: There is also a multiple angle bonus track titled \n             &amp;quot;Instrumedley&amp;quot; which I removed from this release due \n             to issues with the various angles, if you want to see \n             that, buy the DVD!  Due to removing this track, no \n             compression was required, so the rest of the footage looks \n             great!  Enjoy this fine release from AMRCMPG... and once \n             again, buy the damn DVD if you like it, Dream Theater is \n             awesome!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdfe2f1a051983f9cc15d15e32e26f557063e45e","amp;dn":"DREAM+THEATER-LIVE+AT+BUDOKAN+2004+WS+NTSC+DVDR-DVD2-AMRCMPG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdfe2f1a051983f9cc15d15e32e26f557063e45e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,254,47,26,5,25,131,249,204,21,209,94,50,226,111,85,112,99,228,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
