The film, which stars Luke Wilson (Mitch), Vince Vaughn (Beanie) and Will Ferrell (Frank), was directed by Todd Phillips and written by Phillips, Scot Armstrong, and Court Crandall.\n\nThe movie was envisioned by Phillips as a comedy parallel to the cult-classic National Lampoon&amp;#039;s Animal House.[citation needed] It is considered a forerunner to the frat pack since three of its stars are core members of that group.\n\nThis film is number 16 on Bravo&amp;#039;s list of 100 funniest movies.[1]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dc7af24e23c881c68f9787ce2e30f0c433b507a","amp;dn":"OLD+SCHOOL+-+%5BENG%5D%5B2003%5D+-+LIBRE+%26+VERITAS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dc7af24e23c881c68f9787ce2e30f0c433b507a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,199,175,36,226,60,136,28,104,249,120,124,226,227,15,12,67,59,80,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
