When he accidentally freezes himself on December 31, 1999, he wakes up 1,000 years in the future and has a chance to make a fresh start. He goes to work for the Planet Express Corporation, a futuristic delivery service that transports packages to all five quadrants of the universe. His companions include the delivery ship's captain, Leela, a beautiful one-eyed female alien who kicks some serious butt, and Bender, a robot with very human flaws.\n\nAll 4 seasons in high-quality MP4 files prepared for the iPod.  Even includes the proper tags so it will work 100% with iTunes.  If you wonder why I list 4 seasons it's because I followed the production order instead of the broadcast order.\n\nIf you like TV shows on your iPod, check out God The Devil And Bob: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4050681&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4050681&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b14841159e58523f9f263fb9c9cf3919a4d38690","amp;dn":"Futurama+Complete+%28iPod+MP4%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b14841159e58523f9f263fb9c9cf3919a4d38690","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,72,65,21,158,88,82,63,159,38,63,185,201,207,57,25,164,211,134,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
