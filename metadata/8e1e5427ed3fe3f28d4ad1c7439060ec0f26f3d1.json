It was written, performed and recorded in his Nottingham studio during 1994 and released on Em:t Records (Emit Records) in January 1995.\n\nThe album was never advertised and quickly sold on word of mouth alone. Today it is much sought after among collectors and on auction sites like eBay. The album was encoded in 3D by the huge and hugely expensive Roland Sound Space RSS 3D sound imaging system.\n\nGas 0095 has just been remastered and released on Jarvis&amp;#039; new microscopics label.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e1e5427ed3fe3f28d4ad1c7439060ec0f26f3d1","amp;dn":"Gas+%5BHigh+Skies%5D+-+Gas+%28em%3At+0095%29+%281995%2FMP3%2FCBR+320%29+%5Bstmusic.o","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e1e5427ed3fe3f28d4ad1c7439060ec0f26f3d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,30,84,39,237,63,227,242,141,74,209,199,67,144,96,236,15,38,243,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
