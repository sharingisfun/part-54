So with a shiny new HD camera and an intimidatingly sized jib in hand we headed down to R&amp;R studios to film the lads in action.  With cast, crew and jib assembled the five hour shoot turned out to be a massive success. A week later for the second part of the shoot the lads found themselves in more familiar surroundings, namely a pub, where friends and family of the band were cajoled into singing the track picture this... to camera.  The results are viewable via the following link. A big thanks to everyone who helped support the band (invited or not...see the end of the video!).\n\nCo-Director/Cameraman: Graham Sparling\nCo-Director/Producer: Breon Snowdon\n\nREAL DESIGN // SURRECT MEDIA\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b19f478fbcaa8cfb22a768acbb95180dcc291c5","amp;dn":"The+Talks+%5C%22Picture+This%5C%22+Video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b19f478fbcaa8cfb22a768acbb95180dcc291c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,25,244,120,251,202,168,207,178,42,118,138,203,185,81,128,220,194,145,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
