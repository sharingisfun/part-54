There are thousands of different skins to choose from that are freely downloadable from the WindowBlinds website.\nA WindowBlinds skin can make Windows look like an alternative operating system, like their favorite sports or car brand, or something completely new. Because WindowBlinds uses the latest hardware acceleration features of modern video cards, WindowBlinds won&amp;#039;t slow down your computer and uses very little memory.\nWindowBlinds is safe and easy to use. It doesn&amp;#039;t alter any system files and users can switch between the default Windows look and feel and a custom WindowBlinds skin with the click of a button. In addition, WindowBlinds has been tested to ensure it works with Windows Vista, so you know it is compatible, reliable,, and more secure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:68f7f339d17b59c41b8cae40042f30c307de664f","amp;dn":"Stardock+WindowBlinds+v6.02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"68f7f339d17b59c41b8cae40042f30c307de664f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,247,243,57,209,123,89,196,27,140,174,64,4,47,48,195,7,222,102,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
