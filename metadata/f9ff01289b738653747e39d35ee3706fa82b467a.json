Well, all of these made it BIG in that time... enough to put them on a major record label and release on a CD!\n\nI bought this when it came out on CD, but was available on vinyl in 1987.\n\nI highly recommend #4 - Can&amp;#039;t Live Without Your Love by Suzy.  Great driving high energy sound with a sing-a-long melody.  \n\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1. I Can&amp;#039;t Wait - Nu Shooz \t\n2. Baby Love - Regina \t\n3. Two Of Hearts - Stacey Q \t\n4. Can&amp;#039;t Live Without Your Love - Suzy \t\n5. Point Of No Return - Nu Shooz \t\n6. For Tonight - Nancy Martinez \t\t\n7. Showing Out (Get Fresh At The Weekend) - Mel &amp; Kim \t\t\n8. Diamond Girl - Nice And Wild \t\t\n9. We Connect - Stacey Q","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9ff01289b738653747e39d35ee3706fa82b467a","amp;dn":"Dance+Traxx%2C+Vol.+2+%281987%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9ff01289b738653747e39d35ee3706fa82b467a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,255,1,40,155,115,134,83,116,126,57,211,94,227,112,111,168,43,70,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
