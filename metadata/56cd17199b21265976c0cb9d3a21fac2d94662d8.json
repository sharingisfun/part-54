It's a theological reflection...and a call to the Church to focus on things that matter (like living life to the fullest, helping those in need, honoring and respecting all, expecting respect in return) rather than those that don't (like...well, dogma [doctrines/church laws] or any belief that causes us to &amp;quot;draw a line in the sand,&amp;quot; condemning to hell or perdition any who disagree with us). As I watched it (the first and all subsequent times), I felt sure that the movie was written by someone who really loves his church -- but is smart and aware enough to recognize its shortcomings, its blindspots, even its failures and hypocrisies. Rather than simply leaving or ignoring or dismissing it, Smith chooses to enter into dialogue with it, using the potent medium of film to do so. One can only hope that the church--not just Roman Catholic but all branches of it-- takes him up on his call to conversation.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:56cd17199b21265976c0cb9d3a21fac2d94662d8","amp;dn":"Dogma+DivX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"56cd17199b21265976c0cb9d3a21fac2d94662d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,205,23,25,155,33,38,89,118,192,203,157,58,33,250,194,217,70,98,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
