This fantastic double-package by \nCanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s finest songwriter,but not singer(that prize goes to K.D.Lang).Sarah McLachlan\n brings 2004Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s wonderful Afterglow collection to the live arena.After a lengthy hiatus,\nthat included her motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death and birth of daughter India,it was a welcomed return for \nthe highly acclaimed Canadian contemporary-folk star.Caught on film during her nine week \ntour she thrilled the huge venue with songs that were also lifted from previous albums \nFumbling Towards Ecstasy (1993) and Surfacing (1997).In a relaxed mood, flanked by a \nwonderful set and band, ( with some outstanding guitar work by Sean Ashby), she played \nher own favourite songs from a now considerable back-catalaogue.Delighted to re-engage \nwith her adoring fanbase,it was clearly a great thrill to be on the road again.\n\nTechnically,itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s standard filming(multi angled shots)of her performance at the huge \nMolson Amphitheatre Toronto,but a real music loverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s concert.The setlist was badly \nbalanced,as there are long periods of similar paced songs,until it picks up a pace \ntowards the final quarter.McLachlan first came to my attention a few years ago via her \nbrilliant single Angel.If Dido(with whom sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s regularly compared with) hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hit the \nbig time in 2001,she would have become the new sensation in the UK.The three-time Grammy \naward winner,found herself needing to change her songwriting methods for Afterglow.\nHer normal practice of endless months in a log cabin writing songs was reshaped by the \narrival of her first child,as she could only manage a couple of hours a day,which makes \nthis album even more remarkable.Bringing the album to life turned out to be a \nmasterstroke.It brought her back into the limelight in front of sell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ out crowds on \nboth sides of the Atlantic last year.Most of the set consists of slow to mid-tempo \nmelancholic ballads,broken here and there in the last stage by some effective rockier \nsojourns,that lift the atmosphere considerably.Whether it be piano,electric or acoustic \nguitar,she delivers the goods.\n\nExtras include a short peak into her pre-concert preparations and leisure time in Lighthouse Park Vancouver,lyrics page and merchandise details.\n\nYou can also experience most of the gig on a 70 minute CD.\n\nStar tracks: Stupid,Witness,Angel,Fallen,Adia,Train Wreck and Ice Cream.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:de4dd0512d78a4e47d99ea88677e97f3b506335f","amp;dn":"SARAH+MCLACHLAN+FULL+DVD9+%26+CD+%26+DVD+COVER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"de4dd0512d78a4e47d99ea88677e97f3b506335f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,77,208,81,45,120,164,228,125,153,234,136,103,126,151,243,181,6,51,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
