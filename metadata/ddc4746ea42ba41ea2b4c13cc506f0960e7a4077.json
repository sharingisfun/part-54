I will post a few more Dag Nasty shows over the next few weeks, enjoy!\n\nDag Nasty-9-30 Club Washington DC 1985 SVCD 37 minutes\n\nThis is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.\n\nEnjoy bandit999","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddc4746ea42ba41ea2b4c13cc506f0960e7a4077","amp;dn":"Dag+Nasty+9-30+Club+Washington+DC+1985+SVCD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddc4746ea42ba41ea2b4c13cc506f0960e7a4077","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,196,116,110,164,43,164,30,162,180,193,60,197,6,240,150,14,122,64,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
