The title track (Pop #8) and &quot;Time in a Bottle&quot; (Pop #1) are two of his most identifying songs. The lyrics of the title track concerns the fate of a &amp;#039;pool-shooting son-of-a-gun&amp;#039; by the name of &amp;#039;Big&amp;#039; Jim Walker when his &amp;#039;mark&amp;#039; from a south Alabama Honkytonk shows up to get a refund from being hustled or get revenge. The song is notable for the line &quot;You don&amp;#039;t tug on Superman&amp;#039;s cape/You don&amp;#039;t spit into the wind/You don&amp;#039;t pull the mask off the ol&amp;#039; Lone Ranger/And you don&amp;#039;t mess around with Jim&quot;\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ac2690fdee9462add4fa42f7591fa1b0bc32c06","amp;dn":"Jim+Croce+-+You+Don%5C%27t+Mess+Around+With+Jim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ac2690fdee9462add4fa42f7591fa1b0bc32c06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,194,105,15,222,233,70,42,221,79,164,47,117,145,250,27,11,195,44,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
