The result of their legitimately weird brand of bizarro noise-rock sort of left them without much exposure during their time together and are now one of those often overlooked and forgotten gems from the early to mid-nineties. Releasing their first single/EP, Treasure Trail, in 1992 through bassist Tom Flynn&amp;#039;s own record label Boner Records, the band would eventually put out one full length for the label titled Seraphim 280z in 1994 and then make the move to Kill Rock Stars for their second and final album in 1996 titled Docudrama... One of the things that is noticeably unsettling and ultimately makes their music such an oddity is the borderline cutesy vocals from singer E. Marcelle Poulos clashing with Flynn&amp;#039;s sludge filled low end and the high pitched squalls from guitarist Eric Grotke. Not to mention the lyrics were also often a bit twisted as well. The combination works perfectly though, making for a genuinely bizarre, fun, and best of all a noise filled listen.&quot;\n\n\nYou can still buy all of their music, so if you like it, buy it.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.buyolympia.com/killrockstars/Band=Star+Pimp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.buyolympia.com/killrockstars/Band=Star+Pimp&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85b4747be8809723dc7ee8937c486cb0a34e4935","amp;dn":"Star+Pimp+-+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85b4747be8809723dc7ee8937c486cb0a34e4935","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,180,116,123,232,128,151,35,220,126,232,147,124,72,108,176,163,78,73,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
