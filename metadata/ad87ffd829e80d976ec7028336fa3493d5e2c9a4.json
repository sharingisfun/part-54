You see one of them on the left.\n\nThis is done with the selection tools, working with paths and gradient fills.\n\nIf you need something more complicated, go to inkscape and the tutorials from Richard and heathenx. You know the proverb about screws and hammers?.\n\nOne tip: Always use layers. If in doubt, add a new layer and work on that. It gives you some of the flexibilty of a vector based program, you can move, rotate and scale parts of the image without much effort.\n\nThis hat is here with a purpose. I had to shell out more money for this project as planned. And a lot of you have offered assistance. So here I am putting the hat on the street.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad87ffd829e80d976ec7028336fa3493d5e2c9a4","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_049_Simple_Graphics_2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad87ffd829e80d976ec7028336fa3493d5e2c9a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,135,255,216,41,232,13,151,110,199,2,131,54,250,52,147,213,226,201,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
