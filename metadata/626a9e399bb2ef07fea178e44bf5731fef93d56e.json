And I\\&amp;#039;m sharing it as an experiment. Without this, I would not have been able to watch this fun film. \n\nBelieve me, I tried.\n\n\nOk, here\\&amp;#039;s the deal: \n\nI have mild MÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©niÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¨re\\&amp;#039;s disease, the actual medical condition that causes spells of dizziness, often triggered by motion.\n\nI really wanted to see this movie, but didn\\&amp;#039;t want to barf, or even take the chance that feeling nauseous would discract from the pace/energy of the film.\n\nSo, I \\&quot;steadied\\&quot; the entire movie using the excellent virtualdub plugin DeShaker. I highly reccommend it for your own home movies. (http://www.guthspot.se/video/deshaker.htm)\n\nConclusions:\n\nThe process actually worked quite well. What you will see, is that because the shooting is so wild/freehand, steadying the content makes the \\&amp;#039;frame\\&amp;#039; of the movie swing and rotate in the exact opposite way. Watch the timecode move at the beginning to see how wild the camera work is. It\\&amp;#039;s for that reason that I cropped about 10% of the actual frame. If you have a zoom control on your DVD remote, you may want to use it a little to eliminate some of the border swing. You\\&amp;#039;ll see what I mean when you try it.\n\nThat said, this isn\\&amp;#039;t perfect,  don\\&amp;#039;t yell at me because its not a perfect rip. That\\&amp;#039;s not the point. I did this as an experiment, and I\\&amp;#039;ll tell you what, for me, it actually worked, despite the distraction of the frame moving. Someone with vertigo will actually rather have the frame move than the content. \n\nYou\\&amp;#039;ll also see things you missed, because the camera now keeps the main subject(s) centered.\n\nI\\&amp;#039;m currently working on a multi-angle DVD so you can swap between both versions on the fly, just for fun. Stay tuned.\n\nCoded with virtualdub/deshaker/XVID.\n\nPlease comment and let me know your thoughts.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:626a9e399bb2ef07fea178e44bf5731fef93d56e","amp;dn":"Cloverfield+Steadi-cam+VERTIGO+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"626a9e399bb2ef07fea178e44bf5731fef93d56e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,106,158,57,155,178,239,7,254,161,120,228,75,245,115,31,239,147,213,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
