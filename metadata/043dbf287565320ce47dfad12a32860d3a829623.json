I took all the PDF&amp;#039;s, converted them to JPG&amp;#039;s and packed them into CBZ&amp;#039;s so they could be read by the various comic viewers out there (CDDisplay, ComicRack, etc.) I also broke it up by the decades so it would be easier to download than the original 5 gig download.\n\nAll credit for this goes to the original uploader and/or scanner. I just did the conversion from PDF to JPG and packed them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:043dbf287565320ce47dfad12a32860d3a829623","amp;dn":"A+Decade+of+the+X-Men+-+The+60%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"043dbf287565320ce47dfad12a32860d3a829623","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,61,191,40,117,101,50,12,228,125,250,209,42,50,134,13,58,130,150,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
