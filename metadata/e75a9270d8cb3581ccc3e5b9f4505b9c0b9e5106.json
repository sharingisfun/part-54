Still not bad, given the tapes are 27 years old!\n\nWhile not one of the better Roughrider games of that season, the 4th quarter had some very memorable moments, including two touchdowns in an 8 second interval.\n\nDVD (NTSC 4:3) format.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e75a9270d8cb3581ccc3e5b9f4505b9c0b9e5106","amp;dn":"CFL+1981+Tiger-Cats+vs.+Roughriders","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e75a9270d8cb3581ccc3e5b9f4505b9c0b9e5106","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,90,146,112,216,203,53,129,204,195,229,185,244,80,91,156,11,158,81,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
