This will cause the coordinates of the items to be relative to the top-left coordinate of the player window, rather than the screen. Default value is False.\nEx: [MusicPlayer Left=&amp;quot;10&amp;quot; Top=&amp;quot;96&amp;quot; Width=&amp;quot;308&amp;quot; Height=&amp;quot;288&amp;quot; Relative=&amp;quot;True&amp;quot;]\nThis means that an item with (0,0) coordinate will be shown at (10,96).\nNote: Playlist window is still absolute.\n* Added &amp;quot;Direction&amp;quot; attribute to the &amp;quot;Progress&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Volume&amp;quot; element of the music player, which controls the way these element are drawn. Acceptable values are &amp;quot;Up&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Left&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Right&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Down&amp;quot; with &amp;quot;Left&amp;quot; being the default.\n* Added The button (&amp;quot;Element&amp;quot; element) sequence is now honored by the player, meaning you can re-order them and the control sequence will follow that order. It is also possible to omit a button and still keep the sequence intact.\nNote: For music player related skinning, take a look at OrangeShapes_ConstantineMP.zip. This is a skin based on OrangeShapes with Constantine music player theme.\n* Changed ScreenSaver will default to Text mode if Slideshow path or video file is not found.\n*Changed On screensaver text mode, the &amp;quot;tick&amp;quot; sound is suppressed if background music is playing.\n*Changed All fonts has been modified to include characters above ASCII 127. Hence, the caption should also display accented characters.\n\nOfficial Site: http://www.unleashx.com/\nOfficial Forums: http://forums.xbox-scene.com/index.php?showforum=63","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca8dbff413b3e1cea8fdedaa414538fb4d75f96d","amp;dn":"UnleashX+V0+38+0508A+Build+564","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca8dbff413b3e1cea8fdedaa414538fb4d75f96d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,141,191,244,19,179,225,206,168,253,237,170,65,69,56,251,77,117,249,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
