To\n      help celebrate this milestone we've released the next major update,\n      Fraps 2.5.0\n      \n      There's something for everyone with 60 fps recording, HDTV 1280x720\n      supprt, and extra lossless compression that reduces the burden on\n      hard drives without sacrificing quality. If screenshots are more your\n      thing it's also now possible to automatically capture screens at\n      fixed rate intervals.\n      \n      We've also taken advantage of the latest benefits in CPU and bus\n      technology. Think nothing can take advantage of PCI-Express? Think\n      again! Fraps 2.5 can process hundreds of megabytes of video data and\n      make full use of the extra bandwidth.\n      \n      At this point we'd like to extend a very special thanks to all who\n      have supported the program over the years. Your help, suggestions,\n      and registrations have all been instrumental in getting Fraps to the\n      stage it is now and we hope you enjoy the latest release.\n\n\n      For more information:\n      http://www.fraps.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f688f8625d9bad378e1fb48db6e4cb3e73b89fd7","amp;dn":"Fraps+v2.5.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f688f8625d9bad378e1fb48db6e4cb3e73b89fd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,136,248,98,93,155,173,55,142,31,180,141,182,228,203,62,115,184,159,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
