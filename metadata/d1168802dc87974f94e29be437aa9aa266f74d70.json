At the end of the video, the lead vocalist says, &quot;Every action has a reaction.\n\nWe have one planet and one chance.&quot; As well as the version played on television, there was another, more graphic version created. This was never released officially but is available on certain websites. The video serves a testimony to veganism. Rise Against is very active with PETA, and the band members are all active vegans.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1168802dc87974f94e29be437aa9aa266f74d70","amp;dn":"Rise+Against+-+Ready+To+Fall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1168802dc87974f94e29be437aa9aa266f74d70","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,22,136,2,220,135,151,79,148,226,155,228,55,170,154,162,102,247,77,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
