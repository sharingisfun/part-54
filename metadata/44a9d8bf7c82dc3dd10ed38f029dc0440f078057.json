Nothing is more important than that you feel good! And you have absolute and utter control about that because you can choose the thought that makes you worry or the thought that makes you happy; the things that thrill you, or the things that worry you. You have the choice in every moment. --- Abraham\n\nEsther and Jerry Hicks\nIn 1985, Jerry and Esther Hicks began dialogs with Abraham, a name chosen by a group of nonphysical teachers, who deliver an inspirational message of joy and well-being. Jerry and Esther travel to over forty cities every year, offering workshops where participants direct their questions to Abraham and learn ways to achieve all that is desired in life. \n\nAbraham, a group of obviously evolved teachers, speak their broader Non-physical perspective through the physical apparatus of Esther. Speaking to our level of comprehension, from their present moment to our now, through a series of loving, allowing, brilliant yet comprehensively simple, recordings in print and in sound -- they guide us to a clear connection with our Inner Being -- they guide us to self-upliftment from our total self. \n\n===========\n\nNote: I intend to add more of ABRAHAM-HICKS recordings when others can keep up the seeding. My upload speed is slow, if you like this teaching then please help me to seed it. When there are at least 5 stable, established seeders, I will upload some more. So, please seed it for as long as you can.\n\nI like Abe's teachings and I would like to see as many recordings available for download as possible. Please help me to keep up the torrents that are available on the net or at least choose some of those that you would like to share with others. If you have any links to material by Abraham-Hicks that do not show up on the following search links PLEASE share them with me.
