He&amp;#039;s pissed off at everybody, and on Use Your Illusion I ? a sixteen-song tour \n\nde spleen so physically assaultive, verbally incendiary and at times downright screwy that it&amp;#039;s hard to believe there&amp;#039;s a sister disc out \n\nthere just like it ? Guns n&amp;#039; Roses fire on all comers and take no prisoners.\nWomen get it particularly hard. &quot;I call my mother/She&amp;#039;s just a cunt now,&quot; Rose barks in the wrecking-ball boogie &quot;Bad Obsession.&quot; The \n\ntitle &quot;Back Off Bitch&quot; speaks for itself; steaming guitars, killer chorus, shame about the words. Music-biz &quot;kiss-ass sycophants&quot; get their \n\njust desserts in &quot;Garden of Eden,&quot; along with organized religion and the weasels who hold elected office. For all-purpose fuck-you fun, \n\nthere&amp;#039;s &quot;Perfect Crime&quot; (&quot;Motherfucker just let me be&quot;) and guitarist Izzy Stradlin&amp;#039;s bulldozing bagman blues &quot;Double Talkin&amp;#039; Jive&quot; (&quot;Get \n\nthe money, mother-fucker/&amp;#039;Cause I got no more patience&quot;). Like Rose sings in Illusion I&amp;#039;s sole cover, a so-so version of &quot;Live and Let \n\nDie&quot; that just sounds like Wings on steroids, &quot;When ya got a job to do, ya got to do it well/You gotta give the other fella hell.&quot; If nothing \n\nelse, I is a bumper crop of fuzz-fueled invective and pump-action verse, a thousand points of spite.\nIf it was just down to riffs, hooks and body-slam sonics, loving Use Your Illusion I (by itself the equivalent of a double LP) would be no \n\nproblem. Imagine Exile on Main Street&amp;#039;s epic grunge, the shotgun eclecticism of the Beatles&amp;#039; White Album and the lunatic pagan sport of \n\nAlice Cooper&amp;#039;s Love It to Death and Killer albums (Alice himself pops up on one track), all whipped together with the junkyard grace of \n\nRocks-era Aerosmith. That breathless Exile feeling is especially ripe on rockers like &quot;Right Next Door to Hell&quot; and &quot;Perfect Crime,&quot; in \n\nwhich you can barely make sense of Rose&amp;#039;s rapid-fire yelp over the molten guitar soup of Slash and Stradlin. &quot;Dust n&amp;#039; Bones,&quot; sung by \n\nStradlin, is grim n&amp;#039; greasy, feral guitars and funeral-parlor keys echoing Izzy&amp;#039;s shorthand yarn of sex and psychosis out on Highway 666.\nThere are backfires. The ballad &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Cry,&quot; a relic of the Gunners&amp;#039; L.A. club days, is too sweet and pleading; Rose is more convincing \n\nbusting chops. Slash&amp;#039;s classical-guitar break at the end of &quot;Double Talkin&amp;#039; Jive&quot; comes out of nowhere and should have stayed there. But \n\n&quot;November Rain,&quot; overlong at almost nine minutes and overrich with electro-orchestration, has a cool, &quot;Layla&quot;-like coda with sublime \n\nhigh-wire guitar by Slash. In &quot;Dead Horse,&quot; Rose&amp;#039;s desultory acoustic complaint bookends a stunning, volcanic outburst of electric \n\nAero-Stones slammin&amp;#039;.\nOn the other hand, it&amp;#039;s not enough to simply be indignant about Illusion I&amp;#039;s verbal rancor. You ought to be scared for the future. Get past \n\nthe &quot;parental advisory&quot; buzzwords and you hear a declaration of insolence fueled by self-righteous anger and fearful confusion. Guns n&amp;#039; \n\nRoses&amp;#039; rock &amp; roll niggers-with-attitude act, however indefensible at times, is emblematic of a greater adolescent cancer: an almost \n\ntotal loss of hope compounded by blind, impotent rage and the perverted Reagan-Bush morality in which the actual cloth of the Stars \n\nand Stripes is deemed more holy than the freedom and humanity for which it stands.\nIt&amp;#039;s all there in &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Damn Me,&quot; the best song on the record and a striking crystallization of Rose&amp;#039;s ? and his generation&amp;#039;s ? dilemma. \n\n&quot;So I stepped into your world/I kicked you in the mind,&quot; Rose declares in a proud full-moon howl against fierce staccato guitars and a \n\ngalloping rhythm section. &quot;But look at what we&amp;#039;ve done/To the innocent and young/Whoa listen to who&amp;#039;s talking/&amp;#039;Cause we&amp;#039;re not the \n\nonly ones/The trash collected by the eyes/And dumped into the brain/Said it tears into our conscious thoughts/You tell me who&amp;#039;s to \n\nblame.&quot; Empowered by celebrity and his own rock &amp; roll might, even Rose feels dazed and helpless, violently seesawing between &quot;Don&amp;#039;t \n\ndamn me!&quot; and &quot;Don&amp;#039;t hail me!&quot; as the band explodes behind him in one last orgasmic, twin-guitar rush.\nWas Use Your Illusion I worth the wait, the traumas and the onstage tantrums? Yes, if only for &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Damn Me&quot; and the album&amp;#039;s \n\nten-minute closer, &quot;Coma,&quot; a locomotive parable about suicide dreams and troubled resurrection. A few tracks (&quot;Live and Let Die,&quot; the \n\nweird art-metal nightmare &quot;The Garden&quot;) could have stayed on the outtakes shelf and no one would have minded. But the Gunners&amp;#039; \n\nanything-worth-doing-is-worth-overdoing spirit is a bracing slap at the reigning fascism of studio perfection.\nFor better and worse, Illusion I also mirrors the turmoil in Teenage Wasteland, one nation under a grudge. &quot;Not bad kids, just stupid \n\nones,&quot; Rose snaps in &quot;Right Next Door to Hell.&quot; &quot;Yeah, thought we&amp;#039;d own the world.&quot; This is the sound of that dream all shot to hell.
