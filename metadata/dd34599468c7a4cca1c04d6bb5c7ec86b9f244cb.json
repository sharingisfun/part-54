Some of this album is catchy as hell in a really strange way. It&amp;#039;s not easy to describe this album as there&amp;#039;s no other band I know of that has the same style. I could call it &quot;shimmery&quot; I suppose... that captures it better than anything else I can think of. It&amp;#039;s like a fun house of crazy mirrors while on LSD playing  British pop-rock music.\n\nWhite Russian Galaxy, Lottery Winners on Acid, and Girl Just Died are three that constantly and incessantly come back to me.  You really must listen to these tracks.  Don&amp;#039;t expect the whole album to be absolutely great, there are plenty of just average moments in there, but even then they&amp;#039;re different enough to get some enjoyment out of them for at least a listen or two.\n\nTrack list:\n01.
