Perhaps I would agree if they actually developed their own trainer engine instead of using a readily available one.\n\nAs someone who used to also make trainers and bring them freely to the public I am right pissed off that now I dont have time to make those - someone else does and charges people for them. \nAnd no eventually releasing them to the public for free does not cut it. You are taking advantage of people who want those cheats now.\n\nSo here is their trainer in full with watermarks removed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a675f717e0b225eab7f77f2169de8c3e3c0c8dcd","amp;dn":"Sins+of+a+Solar+Empire+1.02+Mega+Trainer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a675f717e0b225eab7f77f2169de8c3e3c0c8dcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,117,247,23,224,178,37,234,183,247,127,33,105,222,140,62,60,12,141,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
