Another Dead Sea Scroll had been found, unlike any before it, describing unimaginable treasures worth untold billions buried in the hills east of Jerusalem and under the Holy City itself.\n\nIn the years that followed, scholars came to believe that THE COPPER SCROLL COULD BE HISTORY&amp;#039;S GREATEST TREASURE MAP, one that could not only lead to the treasures but pave the way to the building of the Third Jewish Temple.\n\nBut the scroll&amp;#039;s code has never been broken, and experts from all sides warn that any effort by Israel to rebuild their Temple in Jerusalem would unleash a war of biblical proportions.\n\nNow, exactly fifty years after the Copper Scroll was unveiled, New York Times bestselling author Joel C. Rosenberg takes you on his most exciting and heart-pounding ride yet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e2295e41f070dfda58fbde91d464baea718cdce","amp;dn":"Joe+C+Rosenberg+-+The+Copper+Scroll","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e2295e41f070dfda58fbde91d464baea718cdce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,34,149,228,31,7,13,253,165,143,189,233,29,70,75,174,167,24,205,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
