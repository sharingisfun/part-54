I&amp;#039;ve seen them live a few time... It&amp;#039;s true MAYHEM... \n\nAux Raus is an Amsterdam based techno punk band consisting of Bastiaan Bosma and Luuk Bouwman. Their idea is simple: to mix the urgency and energy of classic punk rock with contemporary techno and gabber. Songs were written on two drum machines, a shredded guitar and an old computer resulting in a high voltage mix of punk riffage, crowd moving techno beats and pop sensibilities. \n\nCapturing the spirit of the alcoholic dance parties and the dirt of punk shows Aux Raus know how to make a party out of a funeral. Creating a maximum impact with minimal means they became known as the enfants terribles of dance music . \n\nShows took place in bars, squats and seedy discothFques all over the globe: from the undergrounds of Amsterdam, Mexico City and Berlin, to the glamour of Paris and New York City, and back to the welcoming warmth of their parents? livingrooms in Noordwijk and Oss. \n\nIn 2005 the band recorded their debut album in Mexico City called ?This is how this works? which is already in stores in Mexico. The album was produced by Julian Lede, aka Silverio - and Dr. Bono Bonso aka Carlos Navarette. No mames guey. \n\nIt will be released in April 2007 on Angst Recordings from Amsterdam upon which Aux Raus will be unleashed in clubs near you. \n\nTracklist: \n01 - Powder Powder \n02 - Fall \n03 - Rasthof Deutschland \n04 - Men Without Content \n05 - Meat Meets Meat, So What! \n06 - Wire \n07 - This Is How It Works \n08 - Snails \n09 - Copy The Poor \n10 - Naci Viejo \n\nKEYWORDS: \n==================================================== \nPunk , Hard , Electronic , Tekno , Techno , Metal , Hardcore , Atari Teenage Riot , Atari Teen Age Riot , Gabber , New , Amsterdam , Aux , Raus , Mayhem \n\n..Please leave a comment and keep seeding as much as possible..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a811200e25b773a3dd08daad9f0d0497ea5f0e4e","amp;dn":"%5BPPKLP%5D+Aux+Raus+-+This+Is+How+It+Works+%282007%29+%5BMP3%40320kbps%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a811200e25b773a3dd08daad9f0d0497ea5f0e4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,17,32,14,37,183,115,163,221,8,218,173,159,13,4,151,234,95,14,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
