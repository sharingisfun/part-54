This also allows you to simply mount the image as if you had an actual CD in your drive, making it easy to do whatever you choose with it.\n\nBy uploading the best quality audio format available, short of the DTS-HD from the Blu-ray disc (which I&amp;#039;ll be attempting next), I&amp;#039;m giving you the most options available for whatever you decide is the optimum listening environment.  I&amp;#039;ll leave it to each of you to create your own MP3 files in whatever bitrate or manner you see fit, or whatever else you may choose to do.\n\nThe playlist is as follows:\n\n\nDisc One:\n\n01. Speak to Me\n02. Breathe (in the Air)\n03. Time\n04. Breathe (Reprise)\n05. Introduction\n06. Castellorizon\n07. On an Island\n08. The Blue\n09. Red Sky at Night\n10. This Heaven\n11. Then I Close My Eyes\n12. Smile\n13. Take a Breath\n14. A Pocketful of Stones\n15. Where We Start\n16. Intermission Music\n\nDisc Two:\n\n01. Shine On You Crazy Diamond\n02. Fat Old Sun\n03. Coming Back to Life\n04. High Hopes\n05. Echoes\n06. Wish You Were Here\n07. Find the Cost of Freedom (featuring Crosby and Nash)\n08. Arnold Layne (featuring David Bowie)\n09. Comfortably Numb (featuring David Bowie)\n\n\nI hope I&amp;#039;ve done everything right here and that you all will enjoy this most excellent performance.  Any feedback will be viewed as constructive criticism and is most welcome, at least so long as you try not to be overly insulting...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:344d18b4cc8437bfef9b15458e9c7f7cbf774c81","amp;dn":"David+Gilmour%3A+Remember+That+Night-+Live+at+the+Royal+Albert+Hal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"344d18b4cc8437bfef9b15458e9c7f7cbf774c81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,77,24,180,204,132,55,191,239,155,21,69,142,156,127,124,191,119,76,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
