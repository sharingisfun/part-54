Load up MCBoot.elf using Ps1 exploit or AR max. Choose install. Restart PS2 and insert patched PS2 game(memento patcher can be found on official website)choose to run esr beta off usb stick or mem card and screen should flash with a few colours and game should start.\n\nPS Make sure you back up all saves from mem card because this will delete all your saves. I suggest using one mem card to load ps1 exploit then remove it and put mem card you want to  flash files to in slot 1.\n\nAny problems leave a comment.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaed0f2819a5c98ab6937488019c287def1f4c12","amp;dn":"Play+Backups+without+swap","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaed0f2819a5c98ab6937488019c287def1f4c12","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,237,15,40,25,165,201,138,182,147,116,136,1,156,40,125,239,31,76,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
