Winters Bane is the former home of Tim &quot;Ripper&quot; Owens, who of course went gone on to admirably fill the shoes of Rob Halford in Judas Priest and has more recently sung with Iced Earth and his new band, Beyond Fear. But this is guitarist Lou St. Paul&amp;#039;s band, as evidenced by the everchanging lineups over the course of their three albums. It&amp;#039;s the debut, Heart Of A Killer (the only one to feature Ripper) that is their best-known album, a classy power metal with Owens of course shining brightly. A brand-new lineup (below) is set to debut in 2007, and St. Paul and crew have stated their intention to record Heart Of A Killer II sometime in the new year. \n\nReview by: www.bnrmetal.com\n=====================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b58dc59fdabf5c2f0e3b772c22386930fe5e7b6","amp;dn":"Winters+Bane","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b58dc59fdabf5c2f0e3b772c22386930fe5e7b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,88,220,89,253,171,245,194,240,227,183,114,194,35,134,147,15,229,231,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
