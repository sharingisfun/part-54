They are not selected for any other reason than being great albums, but they somehow show the progression from avant-garde jazz, merging with folk music and progressive rock, transforming into present day electronic jazz and progressive metal.\n\nNo longer is there any valid excuse for not having these albums! I think you'd want this collection.\n\nThe albums included are:\n------------------------\nMiles Davis - In a Silent Way\nMichal Urbaniak - Fusion\nNucleus - Labyrinth, Elastic Rock\nKebnekajse - Electric Mountain\nJaga Jazzist - A livingroom hush\nSun Ra - Secrets of the Sun\nMahavishnu Orchestra - Inner Mounting Flame, Bird of Fire\nDave Holland Quartet - Conference of the Birds\nJohn Coltrane - My Favourite Things\nKing Crimson - In the Wake of Poseidon\nJazz Mandolin Project - Jungle Tango\nJan Johansson with Georg Riedel and Rune Gustafsson - Live in Tallinn \nCynic - Focus\n\nAnd a few songs:\nNational Health - Parcivalus\nCherry Five - Country Graveyard\n-----------------------------\n\nI would argue that Nucleus and Mahavisnhu Orchestra are the two central groups in this transformation. Check out Cynic as well, calling them progressive would be a severe understatement.\n\nYou can find more of these artists at Soulseek, the Direct Connect hub [Fallen Angel] or perhaps (doubtfully) at your record store.
