I&amp;#039;ve included a couple of issues that Gerber didn&amp;#039;t write due to them being origin-related. Also included are a couple of issues of Howard the Duck and The Defenders that Gerber wrote in which the Son of Satan guest stars.\n\nThanks to scanners and uploaders. I pulled most of these off of a Son of Satan torrent. Check it out that large torrent if you want to read more about him.\n\nAnybody have a seed for the now-dead Defenders torrent? Lot of good issues and Gerber work in that.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab800dad1265ae9472835a6f70c276f02584bc47","amp;dn":"Son+Of+Satan+-+Steve+Gerber","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab800dad1265ae9472835a6f70c276f02584bc47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,128,13,173,18,101,174,148,114,131,90,111,112,194,118,240,37,132,188,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
