Many have been looking for ways to reset their trials to keep the service from interupting so i am giving back to the community.\n\nSimply run the reset trial.exe file and there will be instructions on how to reset. It\\&amp;#039;s pretty self explanatory.\n\nBtw, this is Kaspersky Internet Security 7.0.1.325 (latest at time of posting). If you do a custom install, you can choose which components NOT to install as the full installation I find to be a little performance degrading.\n\nAs with other people who share, be kind and seed for others to get.\n\n\nMuch Appreciated.\n\n\n--\nfundoman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fee1e984ec9e3e2536f78ab3c73f1904705a407a","amp;dn":"Kaspersky+%28Reset+Trial%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fee1e984ec9e3e2536f78ab3c73f1904705a407a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,225,233,132,236,158,62,37,54,247,138,179,199,63,25,4,112,90,64,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
