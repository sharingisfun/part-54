Ad-aware didn&amp;#039;t help. Here are 4 useful tools plus one I created\n\n\n1) Portable Clamwin- put the PAF file onto a flash drive and extract it\n\n2) Killbox to remove stubborn files\n\n3) Daphne DRK, a process killer, better than the windows task manager\n\n4) Unlocker, to unlock locked processes\n\n5) a vbs file I wrote, it may have worked as I didn&amp;#039;t get a &quot;compilation error&quot; message, which I used in safe mode, then killed the dll processes with Unlocker, then the computer rebooted. If you open the vbs file in notepad it will show the name of the trojan dll, they all have weird names, it could have been the Vundo trojan. Browser hijacks and adware popups everywhere, even when not surfing the web.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebed48ed1f6d17ff98264eb48f31b001bba5b078","amp;dn":"Adware+Removal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebed48ed1f6d17ff98264eb48f31b001bba5b078","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,237,72,237,31,109,23,255,152,38,78,180,143,49,176,1,187,165,176,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
