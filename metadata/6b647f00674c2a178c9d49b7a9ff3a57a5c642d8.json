For example, /banners/ will block anything with the string &quot;/banners/&quot; in it.\n\n    * Integrates seamlessly with Internet Explorer.\n\n    * Dynamically removes and restores images and frames as they are identified without refreshing the browser.\n\n    * Improves performance using optional background downloading and caching of pages/images linked to the ones you&amp;#039;re viewing.\n\n    * Provides fully automated install and uninstall. AdShield is not a personal proxy server, so there&amp;#039;s nothing to configure.\n\n    * Exclude list prevents AdShield from blocking web sites or URLs such as your bank?s website. (e.g., www.my_important_site.com).\n\n    * Identifies web bugs in your browser window. Exposes hidden bugs, which you can then drag to your block list to protect your privacy. Hover text on the web bug indicates the source web site, so you can easily identify it.\n      |\n    * Add Button lets you manually add URLs to either the block list or the exclude list. This feature defaults to the current page you are viewing to help speed the process.\n\n    * Export function lets you easily export your existing block list to share it with other users or to make a backup copy.\n\n    * Cut, Copy and Paste functions help you maintain your AdShield lists.\n\n    * Option to disable the SetTimeOut and SetInterval scripting features, which are responsible for delayed pop-up ads and annoying animated ads.\n\n    * Improved unblocking feature lets you easily identify strings that have been blocked.\n\n    * Improved support for multi-user PC environments such as XP. AdShield now supports user specific block/exclude lists based on user profiles.\n\n    * Network support available.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b647f00674c2a178c9d49b7a9ff3a57a5c642d8","amp;dn":"AdShield+3.0.9.0+Including+Keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b647f00674c2a178c9d49b7a9ff3a57a5c642d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,100,127,0,103,76,42,23,140,157,73,183,169,255,58,87,165,198,66,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
