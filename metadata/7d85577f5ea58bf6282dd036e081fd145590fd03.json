While listening to a track you can \nget it full even if you have started recording from the middle. You can optionally select saving tracks in directories with current date and time. There are many more unique options allowing you to arrange your music and make new downloads. There is an integrated CD recording engine* that allows to create music CDs with CDA and MP3 formats. You have no difficulty in selecting and mixing tracks for recording a disk. \nEach track's parameters and full selected time are indicated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d85577f5ea58bf6282dd036e081fd145590fd03","amp;dn":"3aLab+iRadio+v1.3.0.316","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d85577f5ea58bf6282dd036e081fd145590fd03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,133,87,127,94,165,139,246,40,45,208,54,224,129,253,20,85,144,253,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
