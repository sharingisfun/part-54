This program allows running Backup Copies of SafeDisc (C-Dilla), Securom, Laserlock, CDCOPS, StarForce and Protect CD (and many others) protected games. Also included is a Virtual DVDROM drive (Generic DVD-ROM) enabling you to use your CD images as if they were already burned to CD! DAEMON Tools works under Windows9x/ME/NT/2000/XP with all types of CD/DVDROM drives (IDE/SCSI) and supports nearly any CD protection.\n\nDAEMON Tools supports the following image files:\n\n    * cue/bin\n    * iso\n    * ccd (CloneCD)\n    * bwt (Blindwrite)\n    * mds (Media Descriptor File)\n    * cdi (Discjuggler)\n    * nrg (Nero)\n    * pdi (Instant CD/DVD)\n    * b5t (BlindWrite 5) \n\nNotes:\n\n    * DAEMON Tools needs a 1:1 Copy to run!!\n    * DAEMON Tools is used to RUN GAMES, NOT TO BURN THEM!!! Means emulation must be active while you want to play a game, not while burning the copy (except for you want to use DAEMON Tools&amp;#039; &quot;fastdump&quot; feature on a safedisc protected CD).\n    * If you want to run a copy protected application from an image mounted to a Generic DVD-ROM enabling the copy protection emulation(s) is NOT necessary!!\n    * Generic DVD-ROM is able to run nearly every protected or unprotected CD image (SafediscÃ‚Â®, SecuromÃ‚Â®, LaserlockÃ‚Â®, LockblocksÃ‚Â® etc.) like it was the original CD! Just do an image file using one of the supported burning programs and mount it with Daemon Manager!
