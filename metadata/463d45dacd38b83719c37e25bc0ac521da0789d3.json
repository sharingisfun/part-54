Each computer continues to have its own physical monitor(s) connected to them. When the user moves their mouse from the monitor connected to one computer to a monitor connected to another computer they are then controlling that computer. A universal clipboard is created between the computers so that text and images can be shared. This allows the user to multiply their desktop computing power immensely.\n\nVersion 1.21 may include unspecified updates, enhancements, or bug fixes","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:463d45dacd38b83719c37e25bc0ac521da0789d3","amp;dn":"Stardock+Multiplicity+Pro+1.21+%2B+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"463d45dacd38b83719c37e25bc0ac521da0789d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,61,69,218,205,56,184,55,25,195,126,37,188,10,197,33,218,7,137,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
