Irene is an old\nSeminole woman spending what feels like an eternity in the waiting room of the\nreservation health clinic. She meets two young men, one a construction worker\nin his mid-40s, the other a punk in his 20s. Through their conversations, the\nthree strangers gradually become aware of the assimilation of the American\nIndian. They also come face to face with the sad truth that their culture is\nrapidly disappearing. Written and directed by Oklahoma University grad Sterlin\nHarjo, who belongs to the Creek and Seminole Nations. Cast: Casey Camp Horinek,\nJon Proudstar and Robert Guthrie.\n\nLather Rinse Repeat\nUSA\nLife is filled with many vexing questions. Has it ever occur to you that life\nis a circus and we are all just clowns? What would you rather have: good soup\nor good sex? Why do other family&amp;#039;s arguments always look silly compared to our\nown? And, the most important question, how far will you go to get the last\nword? Written and directed by Matthew Martin. Principle cast: Jeff Stazer,\nVictoria Profeta, Troy Garity, John Fortson, Marshall Bell and Sharon Madden.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kqed.org/arts/imagemakers/episode.jsp?eid=140148&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kqed.org/arts/imagemakers/episode.jsp?eid=140148&lt;/a&gt;\n\n===Show Sponsors===\nMaurice Kanbar, Members of KQED\n\n===Technicals===\nVideo Codec: x264 @ Modified HQ-Insane profile, 975 Kbps, 29.97fps, 880x480\nAudio Codec: AAC @ 64kbit ABR, 2 Channels\nContainer: MKV, 00:29:25, 233 MiB\nSource Chain: Digital OTA (MPEG-1,2 Ch AC3) -&gt; DVICO FusionHDTV 5 RT Gold -&gt;\n              Beyond TV 4 -&gt; Videoredo -&gt; MeGUI -&gt; mkvmerge\n\n===Notes===\nFor some odd reason, this file has jittery playback in VLC.
