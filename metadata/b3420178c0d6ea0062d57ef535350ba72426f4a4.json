And that may be Sean Dillon&amp;#039;s fatal error.\n\nAfter her brothers are killed one by one, Kate Rashid swears vengeance on\nall who have harmed her family. Never mind that they tried to assassinate\nthe president of the United States, that villainy ran in their veins. They were\nher brothers, and her enemies will pay.\n\nMasterfully suspenseful, Midnight Runner is further proof that, in the words\nof the Associated Press, &quot;when it comes to thriller writers, one name stands\nwell above the crowdÃƒÂ¢??Jack Higgins.&quot;\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nREAD ME!: On CD 07 there was a nasty scratch, one that ran parallel on the\nsurface of the disc. I wasn&amp;#039;t able to completely fix the error, but was able to\nsignificantly clean up the rest of the track by buffing the surface of the CD at\nthe damaged area. Still, be aware that starting from ~1:00:51 - 1:06:01 there will\nbe some noticeable skipping, some quite bad.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3420178c0d6ea0062d57ef535350ba72426f4a4","amp;dn":"Jack+Higgins+-+Midnight+Runner+%5B%21%21%21%21%21READ+NFO%21%21%21%21%21%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3420178c0d6ea0062d57ef535350ba72426f4a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,66,1,120,192,214,234,0,98,213,126,245,53,53,11,167,36,38,244,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
