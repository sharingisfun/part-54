(Allows you to use commands like cg_drawshellshock 0 etc.)\nNoFog\nRemove ShellShock\nNoSmoke\nPunkbuster Screenshot Cleaner\n\nOne thing to add about the CVAR/DVAR Bypass. I&amp;#039;m not sure if it&amp;#039;s ok to use on PsB and PBbans servers. Cause they do extra consistency scans or something like that. So if &quot;cg_drawshellshock&quot; is at &quot;0&quot; when the scan takes place then it&amp;#039;ll kick you. But only about 10% of servers run this. If you&amp;#039;re afraid of that.. Just dont change those in the console.\nHow To Use; (Make sure your Punkbuster AND game(1.5) is up to date!)\n1. Download (Obviously )\n2. Unzip all files to the desktop or whatever.\n3. Run aids.exe.\n4. Click the button [...] under DLL and locate &quot;FisH4.dll&quot;\n5. Under Method choose Stealth. (leave everything else as it is.)\n6. Under Process in the dropdown box find iw3mp.exe(the game) and press the [INJECT] button.\n7. CLOSE THE INJECTOR BEFORE JOINING A SERVER\n8. Join a server and press the hotkeys.\n\nHotkeys;\nNUMPAD1 = Name&amp;Distance Tags.\nNUMPAD2 = NoRecoil\nNUMPAD3 = Wallhack\nNUMPAD4 = NoFog\nNUMPAD5 = Remove ShellShock\nNUMPAD6 = NoSmoke\nCVAR bypass is always on.\nPBSS Cleaner is always on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aea0e6a998f2876a45e3986f75c724ecdef049e9","amp;dn":"COD4+Memhack+1.5+-+Wall+hack%2C+no+recoil+Etc.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aea0e6a998f2876a45e3986f75c724ecdef049e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,160,230,169,152,242,135,106,69,227,152,111,117,199,36,236,222,240,73,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
