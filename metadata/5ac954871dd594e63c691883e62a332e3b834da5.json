He\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Bill Hicks reincarnated. I haven\\\\\\&amp;#039;t watched this one yet, but I reseeded it to get rid of the private trackers not allowing DHT. This is my first torrent, so I\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll seed to 150%. Keep it alive, and remember to seed. Actually, if you have your settings tweaked right, the more you upload, the faster your download is. I always watch as I surpass other peers in downloading speed, and a lot of it has to do with them not uploading squat.\n\nI can\\\\\\&amp;#039;t stress enough this link. It has a more info than just forwarding your ports,  and tweaking upload speeds. There is a little program you need that works wonders, and it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s not a virus or full fledged program. It allows you to alter the number of half open ports, which xp by default limits to 10. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bootstrike.com/Articles/BitTorrentGuide/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bootstrike.com/Articles/BitTorrentGuide/&lt;/a&gt; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ac954871dd594e63c691883e62a332e3b834da5","amp;dn":"Doug+Stanhope-No+Refunds%282007%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ac954871dd594e63c691883e62a332e3b834da5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,201,84,135,29,213,148,230,60,105,24,131,230,42,51,46,59,131,77,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
