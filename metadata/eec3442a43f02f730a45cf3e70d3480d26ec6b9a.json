Are they oversold? Or are they worth the extra cash?\nProf Lesley Regan has already exploded some of the myths behind beauty products in a previous Horizon. Now she&amp;#039;s back, to see if the evidence behind these supermarket products stands up to her levels of scrutiny. \nFrom organic farm produce to the billion dollar brands of the UK&amp;#039;s major manufacturers Prof Regan asks tough questions and gets surprising answers. And there&amp;#039;s no sitting on the fence: a product is either &amp;#039;in&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;out&amp;#039; of her scientifically backed supermarket trolley.\n\nProbiotic, superfood, organic: what do all these labels on food mean, apart from making a product more expensive? Professor Lesley Regan, who tested beauty products in a previous episode, tests a variety of supermarket products for their supposed health benefits.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/broadband/tx/supermarket/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/broadband/tx/supermarket/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n419,067,904\nXviD ISO MPEG-4\n49:07.080\n\nthebox.bz\nshunster (public tracker up)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eec3442a43f02f730a45cf3e70d3480d26ec6b9a","amp;dn":"Supermarket+Secrets+%28Horizon%2C+BBC+2%29+2008+02+26+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eec3442a43f02f730a45cf3e70d3480d26ec6b9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,195,68,42,67,240,47,115,10,69,207,62,112,211,72,13,38,236,107,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
