Initially marketed as a    \n    singer/songwriter, John soon revealed he could craft Beatlesque      \n    pop and pound out rockers with equal aplomb. He could dip into      \n    soul, disco and country, as well as classic pop balladry and        \n    even progressive rock. His versatility, combined with his            \n    effortless melodic skills, dynamic charisma and flamboyant stage  \n    shows made him the most popular recording artist of the '70s.        \n    Unlike many pop stars, John was able to sustain his popularity,      \n    charting a Top 40 single every single year from 1970 to 1996.      \n    During that time, he had temporary slumps in creativity and          \n    sales, as he fell out of favor with critics, had fights with his    \n    lyricist Bernie Taupin, and battled various addictions and          \n    public scandals. But through it all, John remained a remarkably      \n    popular artist and many of his songs - including &amp;quot;Your Song,&amp;quot;        \n    &amp;quot;Rocket Man,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Don't Let the        \n    Sun Go Down On Me&amp;quot; - became contemporary pop standards. This is      \n    his latest record, Peachtree Road.                                  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51c155655c5455996156d1240623c2c350bfbf90","amp;dn":"Elton+John-Peachtree+Road-%28Retail%29-2004-BUTT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51c155655c5455996156d1240623c2c350bfbf90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,193,85,101,92,84,85,153,97,86,209,36,6,35,194,195,80,191,191,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
