Idolised by the youth of Paris as much as they&amp;#039;re hated by the police.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267129/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0267129/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nOften mistaken for Japanese, the word yamakasi is actually taken from the Lingala language, which is spoken in the two Congos. Ya makÃƒÂ¡si can mean &quot;strong body, strong spirit, strong person&quot;, though in French usage its meaning is closer to &quot;high energy&quot;. \n\n\nCool Movie, 17 January 2004\nAuthor: TurbDaMan2000 from New Jersey \n\nAlthough i do not understand French, this movie has the ability to show that performing crazy stunts CAN be done without the use of Special effects and computer animations. This movie makes SPIDER-MAN and the MATRIX look realistic and without the millions of dollars used to actually make the visual effects.\n\nRating 10/10\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:62ce2e678474c318701a3c76d0067f4011836fa5","amp;dn":"Yamakasi+-+Les+samoura%C3%AFs+des+temps+modernes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"62ce2e678474c318701a3c76d0067f4011836fa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,206,46,103,132,116,195,24,112,26,60,118,208,6,127,64,17,131,111,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
