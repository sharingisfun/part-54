Lacking any real ambition. He drives his long suffering girlfriend Liz (Kate Ashfield) around the bend. He seems to pay more attention to his fellow loser pals and housemates Ed (Nick Frost)and Pete (Peter Serafinowicz). Other than his basic faults. Shaun is other wise a decent enough sort. But soon realises how much Liz means to him when with out warning. The undead begin to walk the earth (or to shorten it down, Crouch End in London). Now it's a race against time for Shaun to not only spring to the rescue of the girl he loves. But his dear sweet Mum as well. After watching this. You'll never look at 'Dawn of the Dead' the same way again.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c166135c0d06bc80925f9e0773e04d6ce3c96985","amp;dn":"Shaun.Of.The.Dead.DVDRip.XviD-DMT+%2B+swe+srt","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c166135c0d06bc80925f9e0773e04d6ce3c96985","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,102,19,92,13,6,188,128,146,95,158,7,115,224,77,108,227,201,105,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
