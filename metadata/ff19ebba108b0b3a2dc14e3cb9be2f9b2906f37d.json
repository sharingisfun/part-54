It does this by storing the password directly in the EXE file. It is a simple matter to add a password to a file: Just select the desired file on the desktop, in the start menu or in Explorer, open the context menu by right-clicking, select Password protection, enter the password, and youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re done. From that time on, a password will be required to run the EXE file.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff19ebba108b0b3a2dc14e3cb9be2f9b2906f37d","amp;dn":"Exe+Password+2004+%2B+Serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff19ebba108b0b3a2dc14e3cb9be2f9b2906f37d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,25,235,186,16,139,11,58,45,193,78,60,185,190,47,155,41,6,243,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
