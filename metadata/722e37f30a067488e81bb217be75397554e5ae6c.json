The goal is to create a sound that instills a sense of awe in the listener. Lyrical elements express IVÃƒÂ¢??s obsession with dark potential futures and personal inner turmoil. The music can be categorized as Industrial Darkwave with Gothic, Metal and EBM overtones. IVÃƒÂ¢??s members while pretentious with the conception of the music and pedantic with its description do not take themselves very seriously. \n\nHISTORY:\nIntrospect Void was started by a small group of rivet heads in central Florida. Big Ed on Triggers, Jon Jenkins (Malefactors, Swift Knuckle Solution) on vocals, Mike Ringer on Bass, Richard Kimball on guitar and Swamp on synths and guitar. The music was a questionable experiment with random and diminishing tempos. Still high school students at the time a few performances were done around the state before the group dispended to follow other pursuits. \n\nThe next incarnation was the group Biomechanix with Dale Atkins on triggers and vocals, Kanon on vocals and synths and Swamp on guitar. The music was much more polished and more precise. Biomechanix again did a number of shows around the state but disbanded slowly as members drifted off to college and careers. \n\nWhile in college at Gainesville Florida Introspect Void was reformed with Aaron Fledell, Suzy and Swamp all rotating duties as the songs dictated. They did a few shows and then recorded the pseudo live ÃƒÂ¢??CommunionÃƒÂ¢?? CD in a one night bought of inebriation and noise making. The recording was raw, ergo bad, giving a more punk rock quality than darkwave. It was the first recording the band did and it was truly experimental. By the end of the session most of the band had passed out for various unnamed reasons. Being a heavily psychedelic recording with moody feeling the Goth culture responded to it more than the industrial crowd. One track &amp;#039;Palehorse&amp;#039; was a remake of a tune done by Biomechanix. \n\nNotable assistance was provided by Evan Fledell who stood in for his brother on guitar for a few shows and had to listen to IVÃƒÂ¢??s banging while trying to study. \n\nLater I.V. was joined by Brandon Potens and Initium after the break up of ÃƒÂ¢??ÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦and they dissolved like shadowsÃƒÂ¢??. Both brought a new sound to I.V. and encouraged different approaches to the musical problems. Brandon went on to form the ÃƒÂ¢??Deccan TrapsÃƒÂ¢?? project and graduate school (Both Brandon and Suzy are way smarter than the rest of us). \n\nAfter Brandon Potens left, I.V. floundered for a while and some of the members relocated to south Florida. Initium moved down later and his house became the noise facility where Elysia Skye and Ryan Nolan joined to bang on stuff. Elysia then moved out to L.A. to work on here acting career full time. Ryan went on to ÃƒÂ¢??Mission VaoÃƒÂ¢?? and art school. Initium also moved out to L.A. a little later and still provides groovy noises to I.V. at his leisure. \n\nThe south Florida contingent absorbed Spencer and finally pressed the ÃƒÂ¢??Reality is DefectiveÃƒÂ¢?? CD which contains songs recorded in the years during and since the house invasion of InitiumÃƒÂ¢??s flat. \n\nAt the time of this being typed Introspect Void is writing new material with Spencer, Suzy and Swamp. Aaron F. and Initium are adding to the mix remotely from across the country at their discretion. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:722e37f30a067488e81bb217be75397554e5ae6c","amp;dn":"Introspect+Void+-+Reality+Is+Defective+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"722e37f30a067488e81bb217be75397554e5ae6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,46,55,243,10,6,116,136,232,27,178,23,190,117,57,117,84,229,174,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
