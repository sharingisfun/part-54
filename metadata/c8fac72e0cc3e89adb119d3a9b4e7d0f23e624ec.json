My heart is in my shoes, yeah. I went and set the Thames on fire, oh, now I can come back down. She&amp;#039;s laughing in her sleeve, boys. I can feel it in my bones. Anywhere, anywhere I&amp;#039;m gonna lay my head, I&amp;#039;m gonna call my home.\n\nWell I see that the world is upside-down, seems that my pockets were filled up with gold. And now the clouds, well they&amp;#039;ve covered over. And the wind is blowing cold. Well I don&amp;#039;t need anybody, because I learned to be alone. Anywhere, anywhere I&amp;#039;m gonna lay my head, I&amp;#039;m gonna call my home.\n\n(by Tom Waits)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8fac72e0cc3e89adb119d3a9b4e7d0f23e624ec","amp;dn":"Scarlett+Johansson+-+Anywhere+I+Lay+My+Head+%28song%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8fac72e0cc3e89adb119d3a9b4e7d0f23e624ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,250,199,46,12,195,232,154,219,17,157,58,155,78,125,15,35,230,36,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
