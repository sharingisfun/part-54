He is most excellent and brings a unique viewpoint to every role. Without dialog, in a non-technical setting, he's proved that acting is often beyond words. Watching the movie one tends to believe more in the possibility of humanity evolving from baser roots. There was humor, vulnerability, loyalty, and dedication to a goal in his role, and he never spoke a word. He has carried these qualities forward into his other roles, of specific note is Vincent, the sheriff in Happy Texas, and now as Hellboy. This man could be my friend.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9d4a20fba7a212f6087a9d01997a70088240387","amp;dn":"Quest+For+Fire","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9d4a20fba7a212f6087a9d01997a70088240387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,212,162,15,186,122,33,47,96,135,169,208,25,151,167,0,136,36,3,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
