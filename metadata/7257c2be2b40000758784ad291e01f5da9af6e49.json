It was conceived, written and illustrated by Patrick Woodroffe, in collaboration with Dave Greenslade.\n\nThe story - and thus the artwork - within \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;Pentateuch\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039; centres around the discovery of an abandoned spacecraft in orbit around Jupiter, and the project to decipher the ideograms in the pentateuch \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;document\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;. Most of the book is a retelling of the document, in much the same way as a modern translator might retell the contents of a Babylonian tablet or Egyptian papyrus scroll.\n\nGreenslade contributes the 74 minutes of music as his second solo project, enlisting Phil Collins amongst others to help.\n\nA CD reissue was released in 1994, achieving the awkward transfer of Woodroffe\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s 12\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; x 12\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; book into a 5\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; square booklet with some success, though the impact of some of the artwork is lost through this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7257c2be2b40000758784ad291e01f5da9af6e49","amp;dn":"The+Pentateuch+of+the+Cosmogony","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7257c2be2b40000758784ad291e01f5da9af6e49","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,87,194,190,43,64,0,7,88,120,74,210,145,224,31,93,169,175,110,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
