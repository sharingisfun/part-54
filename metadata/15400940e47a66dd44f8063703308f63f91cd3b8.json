The film speaks to former gangsters, shocked by the new levels of casual violence, including one who&amp;#039;s trying to turn youngsters away from guns.\n\nIt follows the latest police efforts to stem the gun culture, going out on patrol with Merseyside Police&amp;#039;s elite anti-gun and gangs unit. And, after weeks on the ground, comes face to face with the young gunmen themselves.\n\nAspect Ratio: 16:9 Widescreen 640x360\n\nVideo: H.264 900kbps 25fps\n\nAudio: AAC 128kbps Stereo\n\n[Frank_UK]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15400940e47a66dd44f8063703308f63f91cd3b8","amp;dn":"Panorama+%5BBBC+One%5D+%5BYoung+Gunmen%5D+%5BH.264%5D+%5BFrank_UK%5D.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15400940e47a66dd44f8063703308f63f91cd3b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,64,9,64,228,122,102,221,68,248,6,55,3,48,143,99,249,28,211,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
