He combines his media presence with actual physical activism, a practice that once led to him being arrested on the personal order of George W. Bush! Alex Jones has gained international attention for standing up for what he believes in.\n\nFrom Italy&amp;#039;s La Prensa to the Wall Street Journal and USA Today, Jones has brought the information war to the mainstream print media worldwide, speaking out against tyranny in defense of the Constitution.\n\nJones has interviewed some of the most amazing minds and the most intriguing personalities in the world from guerrilla journalists to government officials to whistle-blowing intelligence agents.\n\nThe Alex Jones Show is a hard-hitting news and information program unlike any other on the air. Jones is a seasoned investigative journalist who has broken hundreds of national stories during his career. He is an aggressive Constitutionalist who digs deeply into the facts to defend property rights, our nation?s borders, and the Second Amendment while he sends out a rallying call to the American people to resist foreign entanglements and wars for corporate interests. Jones eschews the bogus political labels of ?left and right? and instead focuses on what really matters: what?s right and wrong.\n\nTuesday, June 24th, 2008\n\nTHE EMPIRE IS ON THE RUN..........All 4 PLUS Hours AND OVERDRIVE\n\nAlex welcomes retired CIA officer Ray McGovern, Larry Pratt and Aaron Zelman on the Supreme Court Second Amendment ruling, and Dr. Paul Kossey on the HAARP program.\n\nTotal Recorder 4.4 Capture in 48 kbs stereo from Ku satellite feed or 56 kbs internet streaming audio with commercial edit.
