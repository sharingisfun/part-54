The set-list IMO is great, a lot of good new songs too.\n\nQuality: The video quality is &quot;OK&quot;, it was filmed towards the back of the crowd, in some places it's very joggy (but you can't blame the filmer, he was getting pushed around a bit too!)\n\nSound Quality: The sound quality is pretty damn good IMO, although I don't have many bootleg films I may be mistaken.\n\n\nI have uploaded the song Idiot Son Of An Asshole to my server, so you can see what the quality is like before you download! I wont be deleting the link for a while, however grab it while you can.\n\nhttp://www.zymic.com/The Idiot son of an Asshole.rar\n\nThe show is pretty funny, it's what you expect from these guys, as I say the set-list is also great.. which moves me on to my next thing.\n\nI don't however know the order as the files were never numbered, therefore the setlist below is in a-z.\n\nSetlist:\nBottles to the Ground\nBuggley Eyes and The Decline\nChamps Elysees\nDon't Call Me White\nEat The Meek\nFranco Un-American\nFuck The Kids\nFun Things to Fuck\nLinoleum\nOops, I OD'ed\nOpening song &amp; Murder The Goverment (+ song at end which is sadly cut off)\nRadio\nStickin in my Eye\nThe Idiot son of an Asshole\nThe separation of church and state\nWe Got Two Jealous Again\n\nThe files are all seperate windows media files (.wmv) I believe.\n\nIts def worth the download.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fe5a99fde1c67b54bf7513307dc43e10e16f5e7","amp;dn":"NOFX+-+LIVE+IN+MADRID%2C+SPAIN++2003+BOOTLEG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fe5a99fde1c67b54bf7513307dc43e10e16f5e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,229,169,159,222,28,103,181,75,247,81,51,7,220,67,225,14,22,245,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
