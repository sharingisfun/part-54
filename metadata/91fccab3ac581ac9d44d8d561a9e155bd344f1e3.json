A century later, in a world filled with car-related environmental and social problems, Return of the Scorcher discovers an inspired and evolving bicycling renaissance.\n\nThis documentary touches on a surprising variety of subjects including romance, rebellion, early feminism, and spirituality - all viewed within the context of bicycling.\n\nReturn of the Scorcher questions our obsession with \\\\\\&quot;progress\\\\\\&quot; and status and presents a diverse cross-section of cycling visionaries who see the bicycle as a life-affirming vehicle for change.\n\nFeatured interviewees include: Marcia Lowe, Michael Replogle, Iain Boal, Ellen Fletcher, George Bliss and others.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tedwhitegreenlight.com/scorcher.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tedwhitegreenlight.com/scorcher.htm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91fccab3ac581ac9d44d8d561a9e155bd344f1e3","amp;dn":"Return+of+the+Scorcher","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91fccab3ac581ac9d44d8d561a9e155bd344f1e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,252,202,179,172,88,26,201,212,77,141,86,26,158,21,91,211,68,241,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
