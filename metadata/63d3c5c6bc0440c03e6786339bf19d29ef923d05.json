It spawned a major hit single, &quot;My Girl&quot; that got regular airplay in Canada and the U.S. This was the first Chilliwack single to achieve success outside of Canada. &quot;I Believe&quot; was another minor hit off the album. Overall the album is something of a concept album about the &quot;rock and roll&quot; lifestyle and the pursuit of fame. The leadoff track &quot;Sign Here&quot; is a reference to Chilliwack's new quest for mainstream success after the collapse of their former label Mushroom Records. This was the first album they recorded with Solid Gold Records.\n\nTrack listing:\n\nSign Here\nSo You Wanna Be a Star\nTell It to the Telephone\nToo Many Enemies\nLiving In Stereo\nMy Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)\nMr Rock\nDon't Wanna Live for a Living\nWalk On\nI Believe\n\nMy rip @ 320kbps\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63d3c5c6bc0440c03e6786339bf19d29ef923d05","amp;dn":"Chilliwack+-+Wanna+Be+A+Star+%281981%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63d3c5c6bc0440c03e6786339bf19d29ef923d05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,211,197,198,188,4,64,192,62,103,134,51,155,241,157,41,239,146,61,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
