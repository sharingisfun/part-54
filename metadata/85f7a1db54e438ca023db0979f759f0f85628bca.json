This tool allows to run starforce mini-images without disabling your cd or dvd-drives in the bios or removing the cables from them. This tool is 100% legal, because it doesnt modify any starforce file in any way. From what I have understood it disables your cd or dvd-drives in the device-manager automaticly and hides your disabled cd or dvd-drives from being detected by starforce by simply issueing some commands through windows (it probably puts them in stand-by mode).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85f7a1db54e438ca023db0979f759f0f85628bca","amp;dn":"Starfuck+-+Disable+Starforce","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85f7a1db54e438ca023db0979f759f0f85628bca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,247,161,219,84,228,56,202,2,61,176,151,159,117,159,15,133,98,139,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
