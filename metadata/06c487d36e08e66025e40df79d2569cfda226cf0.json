NOTHING added NOTHING taken away besides what is allowed\n\nwithin vLite.\n\n\n\nWith my limited knowledge I opened vLite and looked at the settings from this Vista \n\ninstallation:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4019916/Vista_Gamers_Edition_(by_megaposter)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4019916/Vista_Gamers_Edition_(by_megaposter)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI wrote down all settings and duplicated them with a Vista Ultimate x64 setup.\n   (a x32 is on it&amp;#039;s way)\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHere is essentially what this Vista install contains.\n\nComponents:\n\n  -Accessories\nPaint\nSystem Information\nWordpad\n\n  -Drivers\nEthernet Network Adapters\nQlogic Fibre Channel Adapter\nSound Controllers\n\n  -Hardware Support\nDynamic Volume Manager\nModem Support\n\n  -Multimedia\nSample Pictures\n\n  -Network\nInternet Explorer\nRemote Desktop Client\n\n  -Services\nMultimedia Class Scheduler\nOffline Files\n\n  -System\nMicrosoft HTML engine\nPerformance Counters\nReadyBoost\nRemote Differential Compression\n\nDEP Disabled (AlwaysOff)\nUAC OFF\n\nHibernation Off\nPaging Exec Enabled\nPower settg High Performance\n\nShow exts. for know file types  Yes\nShow hidden files and folders   Yes\nShow protected OS system files  Yes\n\n\nNO AERO THEME, WINDOWS CLASSIC FTW!\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\n\nI had trouble with megaposters Vista installing any updates, particularly KB940105 \n\n(Virtual Address Memory hotfix) which fixes Crysis from randomly quitting to the \n\ndesktop for me.\n\n\nThis version CAN INSTALL UPDATES via Windows Update OR .msu&amp;#039;s, .exe&amp;#039;s etc.\n\n\nI have also integrated all hotfixes suggested on Nvidias website:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nvidia.com/object/windows_vista_hotfixes.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nvidia.com/object/windows_vista_hotfixes.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nATI users can uninstall KB945149 if they have problems, all other hotfixes are also \n\nlisted on ATI&amp;#039;s site.\n\n\n\nIf you know of any other updates that would specifically help this GAMING version \n\nof Vista, plz post and I will integrate with a later version (probably when SP1 \n\ncomes out, as i will create an integrated release then) Also if you know any safe \n\ntweaks, registry edits, general tips, ANYTHING that would aid FPS and game\n\nperformance PLEASE FEEL FREE TO POST!!! Any way I can make this simple release \n\nbetter too, constructive criticism always welcome!\n\nThis Vista uses appx. half (less even!) the RAM of regular Vista Ultimate x64","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06c487d36e08e66025e40df79d2569cfda226cf0","amp;dn":"Windows+Vista+Gamers+Edition+x64+Unattended","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06c487d36e08e66025e40df79d2569cfda226cf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,196,135,211,110,8,230,96,37,228,13,247,157,37,105,207,218,34,108,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
