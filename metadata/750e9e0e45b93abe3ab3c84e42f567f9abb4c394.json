While her debut disc Out Of This Mood successfully capitalized on her good looks and exotic moniker, Shades Of Delight makes the case that she could be a flash-in-the-pan for the Nagel Heyer label. Through a mix of popular jazz standards and not-so-standard African traditional songs, Lyambiko&amp;#039;s quirky mezzo-soprano strains for feeling but ends up sounding like a jazz version of Sade.\n\nPersonnel:\nLyambiko - vocals, clave\nMarque Lowenthal - piano\nRobin Draganic - bass\nTorsten Zwingenberger - drums, percussion\n\nTrack Listing:\n1. Moondance\n2. Tenderly\n3. I&amp;#039;ve Got My Love to Keep Me Warm\n4. Lush Life\n5. Your Mind Is on Vacation (And Your Mouth Is Working Overtime)\n6. Black Coffee\n7. Morning\n8. Dindi\n9.
