Largely impenetrable to the non-believer, it&amp;#039;s almost obligatory for scoffers to dismiss it as little more than a glorified spreadsheet. However, the comparison is as irrelevant as it is tired - we&amp;#039;ve yet to discover a spreadsheet that can keep us entertained for six hours straight. And besides, it&amp;#039;s a lot easier to use than a spreadsheet.\n\nNevertheless, those who have been dissuaded by the seemingly complex interface are being targeted this year, as Football Manager attempts to encroach even further into civilised society. Whereas you were previously stranded with little more than a stuffy manual and your own wits, this year&amp;#039;s model will lead you by the hand into its sinister world of football based number crunching.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c48b684039ba93bcb725c4b71fc27a0d7ecc46e0","amp;dn":"Football+Manager+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c48b684039ba93bcb725c4b71fc27a0d7ecc46e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,139,104,64,57,186,147,188,183,37,196,183,31,194,122,13,126,204,70,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
