She demands that her boyfriend kill himself too, or she&amp;#039;ll keep on being a bitch. \n\nPring, a landlord&amp;#039;s daughter, liked playing fiddle very much. She fell in love with a servant named Thai, who was skillful at playing fiddle as well. But Pring&amp;#039;s father soon discovered this inappropriate love and broke them up by secluding his daighter for the time being. However, Pring hanged herself, leaving a horrific face. The ghost of Pring emerged in no time: she first tragically killed Sorn, who suffocated her after an attempted rape, only to take her life. \n\nWhat&amp;#039;s worse, Pring leaded the voodoo, Sorn&amp;#039;s father and his servants, who tried to destroy her, to a sticky end. Finally, the frightened villagers and the head asked Thai to cooperate with priest, who schemed to trap Pring in a small magic-sealed cottage, which was set on fire to eliminate her. But Pring finally managed to break loose. With anger, she set out to kill all the people on the scene, unless Thai would live with her forever. What decision would Thai make, to save all those innocent lives? \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ethaicd.com/show.php?pid=13650&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ethaicd.com/show.php?pid=13650&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c3082f2d44c8d6ca09d59d8d8d34ab727f9bdba","amp;dn":"Thai+Movie+-+Crying+Fiddle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c3082f2d44c8d6ca09d59d8d8d34ab727f9bdba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,48,130,242,212,76,141,108,160,157,89,216,216,211,74,183,39,249,189,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
