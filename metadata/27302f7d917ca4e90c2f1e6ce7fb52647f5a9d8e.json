To further support the claims made in Zeitgeist the movie I decided to compile my own research into this Info DVD.\n\nThe DVD holds many sources like weblinks, videos and literature. Also, it includes freeware software burning programs and manuals so that people can easily make copies of Zeitgeist (and the info DVD) for their friends, co-workers, loved ones and neighbourhood folks.\n\nGoal of the Research DVD: to share information and to encourage distribution of Zeitgeist &quot;outside&quot; the realm of internet. Zeitgeist has a huge internet following but with this DVD I hope hard copies of the movie will spread to people who aren&amp;#039;t as active on the internet as us torrentfreaks :).\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSoftware\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this torrent you will find Iso-burner, which is a freeware ISO-burning program.\nAlso, you will find Magicdisc, which is a freeware virtual drive program to watch and run the included ISO files directly on your computer without first burning them.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI will SEED this torrent as long as I can possibly afford. My upload isn&amp;#039;t that high (2 Mbit/s) so I hope you guys will SEED this as much as possible. \n\nI thank you very much,\n\nThe revolution is NOW!\n\n[b]Note:[/b] Soon I will upload Zeitgeist the movie multilanguage in both NTSC &amp; PAL format. Make sure to look it up!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27302f7d917ca4e90c2f1e6ce7fb52647f5a9d8e","amp;dn":"Research+DVD+on+Zeitgeist+the+movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27302f7d917ca4e90c2f1e6ce7fb52647f5a9d8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,48,47,125,145,124,164,233,12,47,30,108,231,251,82,100,127,90,157,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
