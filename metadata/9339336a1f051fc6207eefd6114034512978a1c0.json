It is the birthday of liberated Bulgaria. It is a bright day, which comes after 500 years dark, slave night. It is a day of Bulgarian resurrection. A day that Bulgarians write with capital letter Liberation! \nAs we know by force of the tragic historical fate Bulgaria interrupts its independent existence as a country at the end of the XIV century when it has reached significant achievements of its political and cultural development.\n\tBut Bulgarian freedom-loving spirit is not broken. The whole history of our nation from the XV to the XIX century is a sequence of permanent heroic struggles for freedom. This is unique epoch of national glory and immortality. There are thousands of names of those Bulgarians who have dedicated their life to this struggle.\nThe highest zenith of the development of our national revolution is the rebellion in April 1876. Turkish army ruthlessly crushes it.\n A great many lives 30 000 have been lost children, women, old people.   200 settlements have been burnt down. A wave of protests swarms the pages of the European newspapers. The European public rises in defence of Bulgarians. It forces the Great Powers to turn their gaze onto Bulgarians.\nIn 1877 the next war between Russia and Turkey begins. Bulgarian volunteers fight together with the Russian soldiers in the battles for Stara Zagora, Shipka, Sheinovo, Pleven, Lovech and Sofia. Russia wins a victory over Turkey. \nOn 3 March 1878 at the suburb of Istanbul, San Stefano, was signed a preliminary treaty, which entered the history as a San Stefano Peace Treaty. According to the treaty the Bulgarian country was restored. It included almost all lands where Bulgarians lived. According to the treaty 4 800 000 people lived in Bulgarian principality and 88 % of them were Bulgarians. At that very moment the Bulgarian nation saw its realized national ideal the freedom of the Bulgarians all over the country.\nThe Bulgarians obtained possibility independently to destine their fate, to develop free private initiative in protected possession and safeguarded citizen rights. Bulgaria became one of the European countries started along the road of prosperity. \nNow we look intently at the time and look for the truth about that day. Maybe it had been snowing, maybe rain had been pouring, maybe storm had been blustering? Maybe! But for us Bulgarians it is a day full of sunlight, rich in joy and hope, a day of our Liberation! It passes through our hearts, souls and thoughts!\nSnow-white snowdrops ring with their white campanulas in the stillness in front of the memorial tablets, granite monuments where battles have seethed and dying words have been said! The grateful Bulgarians bow down to the heroism of their ancestors!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9339336a1f051fc6207eefd6114034512978a1c0","amp;dn":"Time.of.Violence.1988","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9339336a1f051fc6207eefd6114034512978a1c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,57,51,106,31,5,31,198,32,126,239,214,17,64,52,81,41,120,161,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
