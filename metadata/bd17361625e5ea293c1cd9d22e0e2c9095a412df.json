Hancock&amp;#039;s Half Hour kicked off in November 1954 becoming a very British, comic-institution for almost two decades. \n\nStarring Tony Hancock, the show&amp;#039;s writers Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, created the winning and loveably snobbish, very British gent with social aspirations and delusions of grandeur - Tony&amp;#039;s thespian, gangster alter ego - aka Tony Hancock. &amp;#039;The lad himself&amp;#039;, bumbled through life, belligerent and insecure, defiant in the face of constant failure yet refusing ever to concede defeat. \n\nSet in 23 Railway Cuttings, East Cheam it followed the capers of those who lived in what became one of the most famous fictional streets in Britain. With razor sharp wit embedded cleverly in a fast moving script, Hancock&amp;#039;s thespian ability with a witty twist was enhanced by a plethora of comic talent; Bill Kerr was the Aussie from Wagga Wagga, Sid James Hancock&amp;#039;s villainous landlord, Hattie Jacques played secretary Griselda &amp;#039;Grizzly&amp;#039; Pugh and Kenneth Williams sneered through his role as Snide - his infamous catch phrase, &quot;Oooo, stop messing about,&quot; made its first appearance on the show. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd17361625e5ea293c1cd9d22e0e2c9095a412df","amp;dn":"Hancocks+Half+Hour-Series+One-Episode+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd17361625e5ea293c1cd9d22e0e2c9095a412df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,23,54,22,37,229,234,41,60,28,217,210,46,14,44,144,149,164,18,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
