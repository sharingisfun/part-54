Eddie Murphy returned to greatness with his first good movie in awhile. Hopefully this is the start of something good by having these two amazing actors working together. &quot;Are you gonna eat that cornbread?&quot; I couldn&amp;#039;t stop laughing the whole time I was there. I give Life a 10 and recommend it to everyone. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83d4138bebce01e7cece69e573bd75350d477169","amp;dn":"Life.DVDRiP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83d4138bebce01e7cece69e573bd75350d477169","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,212,19,139,235,206,1,231,206,206,105,229,115,189,117,53,13,71,113,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
