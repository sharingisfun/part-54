This time its weapons are not the Red Army or its nuclear arsenal, but the huge energy resources lying under the Siberian tundra. Vladimir Putin is the man responsible for the reemergence of Russia as a global power, but how much is really known about him and his ascent to power? This film explores his journey to the highest echelons of the Kremlin and puts context to his rise against a new Russia. One that is nostalgic for the past glories of the Soviet empire.\n\nSEED UNTIL YOU BLEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d4bc3602021990f28f7aaecadd4ecc9f7e63c9a","amp;dn":"The+Putin+System.divx","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d4bc3602021990f28f7aaecadd4ecc9f7e63c9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,75,195,96,32,33,153,15,40,247,170,236,173,212,236,201,247,230,60,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
