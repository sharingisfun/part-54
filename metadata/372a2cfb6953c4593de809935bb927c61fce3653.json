Leona was discovered from a British tv-series called The X Factor (music talent show like Pop Idol) which she won under Christmas 2006. First half of this documentary concentrates on Leona&amp;#039;s actual performances in that competition. Several performances are shown completely without forgetting valuable judge comments (&quot;legendary&quot; Simon Cowell is also there!). For me this first half really gives the most because Leona&amp;#039;s emotional interpretations of old classics are simply incredible. I can&amp;#039;t remember ever seeing or hearing anything as beautiful. The second half consists &quot;Winners&amp;#039; Week&quot; type of material with interviews etc.\n\nScreenshots: http://xs.to/xs.php?h=xs226&amp;d=08143&amp;f=leona__s_x_factor588.jpg\n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 1 GiB for 1h 27mn 19s 440ms\n\nVideo #0          : DivX 5 at 1498 Kbps\nAspect            : 640 x 480 () at 25.000 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3 at 192 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 44.1 KHz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:372a2cfb6953c4593de809935bb927c61fce3653","amp;dn":"Leona%5C%27s+X+Factor.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"372a2cfb6953c4593de809935bb927c61fce3653","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,42,44,251,105,83,196,89,61,232,9,147,91,185,39,198,31,206,54,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
