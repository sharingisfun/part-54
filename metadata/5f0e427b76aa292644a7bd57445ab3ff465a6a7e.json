It was later released as a single, and is their only song to become a Top 10 hit in the United States, reaching #8 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.\n\nThe Clash made low-budget music videos for several of their songs, and the one for &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; may be their most memorable. Filmed in Austin, Texas, it depicts an Arab, played by Bernie Rhodes, and an Hasidic Jew, played by Mark &quot;Frothler&quot; Helfont, skanking together through the streets, often followed by an armadillo, interspersed with the band performing in front of an oil well. The humorous tone of the video fits the song, although it is easy to read the antics of the Arab and Jew as a desire for better relations between Israelis and Arabs.\n\nThe video features their first drummer Terry Chimes, because, at the time of its release, Headon was out of the band due to his growing drug addiction. Headon admitted that seeing the video with &quot;someone else at my place, playing my song&quot; was very painful for him and he spiraled deeper into depression and drug abuse.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f0e427b76aa292644a7bd57445ab3ff465a6a7e","amp;dn":"The+Clash+-+Rock+The+Casbah","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f0e427b76aa292644a7bd57445ab3ff465a6a7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,14,66,123,118,170,41,38,68,167,189,87,68,90,179,255,70,90,106,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
