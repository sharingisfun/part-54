(Mobley would bring the same group back in the studio that December, sans Green, to make \\&quot;Another Workout\\&quot; -- now there\\&amp;#039;s a CD that needs to be reissued!) The playing is smooth and straight-ahead, powered by great solos and great compositions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdf18ce294e788463f23b9623631040df4e21624","amp;dn":"Hank+Mobley+-+Workout","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdf18ce294e788463f23b9623631040df4e21624","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,241,140,226,148,231,136,70,63,35,185,98,54,49,4,13,244,226,22,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
