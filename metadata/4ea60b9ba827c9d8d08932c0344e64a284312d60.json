Both My Friends\n\n\nReview from www.Amazon.com\n\nIf you didn&amp;#039;t know better you&amp;#039;d think this was an early Eminem CD sans all the trash talking. But Scapegoat Wax, a.k.a. Marty James, was still thrashing out beats and making up rhymes in his Chico, California, bedroom when Eminem first gave the world the finger. But to be fair, Mr. Wax is rather more versatile than Eminem, going far beyond rap as he slices and dices sci-fi effects and other aural bon mots into old-school funk-rock that recalls Sly Stone and Shuggie Otis. Most of the songs have a well-developed sense of melody and timing, especially the impeccably crafted &quot;Space to Share,&quot; which is a near-perfect pop confection. But it&amp;#039;s literate, imaginative raps like &quot;Aisle 10 (Hello Allison),&quot; the autobiographical &quot;Almost Fine,&quot; and the anxious &quot;Back Alive&quot; (detailing his brief tenure on the Beastie Boys&amp;#039;s Grand Royal label) that make this album memorable. --Jaan Uhelszki","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ea60b9ba827c9d8d08932c0344e64a284312d60","amp;dn":"Scapegoat+Wax+-+SWAX+%28incl.+music+video%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ea60b9ba827c9d8d08932c0344e64a284312d60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,166,11,155,168,39,201,216,208,137,50,192,52,78,100,162,132,49,45,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
