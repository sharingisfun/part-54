This is version 1 of the game and not the second version that so many people complain about. It does not feature any mods that are included on other versions loaded on this site.\n\nInstall Daemon Tools\nMount the GTA ISO\nThen Install\n\n\nAfter installation browse the contents of the dvd image and look for the folder Hoodlum and copy the EXE file and replace the installed EXE file.\n\nDO NOT RUN THE INTRO MOVIE FILE LOCATED IN THE HOODLUM FOLDER. IT CONTAINS SOME ADWARE.\n\nPlease make sure you have virus protection before installing this program once it installs your protection will imediately block any stuff that is bad after that you should be in the clear. It runs on my computer just fine and was downloaded using emule.\n\nDo not enter the ped riot cheat or riot mode cheats untill after you have beaten the game. Do not exceed 500 cheats untill you have surpassed the Mad Dogg mission. The developers have it rigged to not let you proceed to any other missions. \n\nNo serials needed and no fancy video cards. \n\nI will try and seed this one as much as possible. But I still gotta use the computer too. Download the torrent and you might get it before any of the other sources.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f342c7f9c08f033d55ca2bb32a2e22219d421555","amp;dn":"Grand+Theft+Auto+San+Andreas+-+Hoodlum+v1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f342c7f9c08f033d55ca2bb32a2e22219d421555","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,66,199,249,192,143,3,61,85,202,43,179,42,46,34,33,157,66,21,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
