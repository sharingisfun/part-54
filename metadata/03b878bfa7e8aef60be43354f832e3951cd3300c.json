It was finished, packaged and placed in stockings in the wee hours of Christmas night (2007) and released for free download at www.jonathansproject.com as a debut.\n\n&quot;Hard Holidays is a 6 track bedroom demo EP loaded with blips, bleeps, strums &amp; beats backing 5 original works and 1 Dntel (The Postal Service) remix. Intimate and emotional, jonAthan?s soft and digital sound-craft is dashed with warm acoustics, rich harmonies and heartfelt lyrics.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jonathansproject.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jonathansproject.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n&quot;a gorgeously understated listen&quot; - mp3hugger.com\n\n&quot;frequent yet never excessive beats, engaging ambient effects, ethereal guitars in shoe-gazing style, melody thrown randomly here and there and a slightly strained voice that appears every once and a while. this album is perfect for clearing your head and staring out the window at the raindrops, light, and cement.&quot; - indieforbunnies.com\n\n&quot;a seductive combination of electronica and hushed vocals&quot; - lostinyourinbox.com \n\n&quot;nice and relaxing - makes you feel good on a rainy day&quot; - allthepeoples.com\n\n\nJon Athans Project\nHard Holidays Demo EP\nDecember 24th, 2007 Release\n\n1) AM Alarm\n2) Humid in Town\n3) Hard Holidays (Silent Night Mix)\n4) Used Books, Torn Pages\n5) Nations\n6) Dumb Luck (jonAthan&amp;#039;s Home Alone Mid-20s Remix)\n\ndumb luck original by dntel\nall other songs written &amp; programmed by jonAthan\nblips bleeps strums &amp; beats recorded in my bedroom\nart &amp; packaging by tia ninzeheltzer\n\n&quot;bedrooms make the music&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03b878bfa7e8aef60be43354f832e3951cd3300c","amp;dn":"Jon+Athans+Project+-+Hard+Holidays+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03b878bfa7e8aef60be43354f832e3951cd3300c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,184,120,191,167,232,174,246,11,228,51,84,248,50,227,149,28,211,48,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
