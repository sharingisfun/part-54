They signed to\nMaverick/Warner in 2004. This is their upcoming, untitled full\nlength disc, many months early.  Talks have surrounded naming the\nalbum 'Walker's Ridge', which in my opinion is an excellent\nchoice. The record was produced by John Feldmann (Goldfinger,\nStory of the Year, The Used).  We decided to tag 2005 even though\nthe plans are to release it sometime in January 2006.  Enjoy a\nkiller sound from a talented band. Be sure to check out their \nmyspace page.   www.myspace.com/citysleeps \n\nLook for them in the future,they are going to be huge! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8087e2bfc2ba249e081f361f1e97f8a7a40f0d64","amp;dn":"City_Sleeps-Untitled-%28Advance%29-2005-MTD+%5BRock%2FAlternative%2FModern","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8087e2bfc2ba249e081f361f1e97f8a7a40f0d64","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,135,226,191,194,186,36,158,8,31,54,31,30,151,248,167,164,15,13,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
