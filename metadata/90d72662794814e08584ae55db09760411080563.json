Tank Girl!  What will I pull out of my ass next!  Starring Malcolm McDowell. Lori Petty, Naomi Watts, and the negro rapper ICE-T.  ICE-T plays a Kangaroo like humanoid...he was good for the role, as he didn't really need much makeup to look like an animal. ;)\n\nAnd look at Malcolm McDowell!  Yes, it's ALEX from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  How old is he now?  This movie came out in 1995, and he was an old man THEN.  I hope he doesn't die soon, as I really enjoy his films.\n\nAll in all, this was a highly entertaining movie...which runs fairly true to the comic series of the same name, which inspired the movie...FROM WHAT I HEAR.  I don't read comics, they are for children...So correct me if I am wrong, but please also state that you are 8-12 years old in your comment.\n\n----\n\nThe Year is 2033. Earth has been clobbered with a comet, civilization has been destroyed, and it hasn't rained in 11 years. Nearly all the water on the planet is controlled by the evil Water and Power company, which is in turn controlled by the even more evil Kesslee (Malcolm McDowell). Who stands in the way? Some mysterious mutants called the Rippers and, of course, Tank Girl. Lori Petty plays Tank Girl, the wisecracking, defiant heart of the movie, as kind of an inner child gone wild. Unfortunately Petty can't quite carry a movie on her own--her zingers frequently fall flat and she seems to be continually worried that we still like her. Luckily there's Naomi Watts as Jet Girl to save the day: smart, shy, and inherently way more appealing than Tank Girl. Tank Girl is based on the comic of the same name, and it is visually an eye-popper. It's worth watching for the insane set and costume designs alone.\n\n----\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: XviD 1.0.1\nBitrate: 810 kb/s AVG\nAspect: 640x272 = 1.35:1\nAudio: English, 128 VBR Stereo @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: None\nRuntime: 01:43:48\nFPS: 23.976","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90d72662794814e08584ae55db09760411080563","amp;dn":"Tank+Girl+%28xvid101-sickboy88%29+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90d72662794814e08584ae55db09760411080563","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,215,38,98,121,72,20,224,133,132,174,85,219,9,118,4,17,8,5,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
