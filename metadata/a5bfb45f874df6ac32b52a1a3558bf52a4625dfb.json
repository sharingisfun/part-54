It was the Centenary final (although only the 91st final due to world wars) and the 44th to be played at Wembley. It was contested between cup holders Arsenal, who had won the English Championship and FA Cup the previous season, and Leeds United, who had won the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup and finished 2nd in the league the previous season. Arsenal planned to make it the third decade for a club to return as Cup-holders and win again for the second successive year, as Newcastle had done in 1952 and Tottenham in 1962.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5bfb45f874df6ac32b52a1a3558bf52a4625dfb","amp;dn":"1972+FA+Cup+Final+Arsenal+vs+Leeds+United","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5bfb45f874df6ac32b52a1a3558bf52a4625dfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,191,180,95,135,77,246,172,50,181,42,26,53,88,191,82,164,98,93,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
