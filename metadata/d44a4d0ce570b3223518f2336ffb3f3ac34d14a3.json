I think they were from Argentina if I remember correctly... not 100% on that. Their short &quot;GoGo En Rojo&quot; EP is catchy, has a few Spanish originals, then also two Kinks covers- All Day and all of the night &amp; You really got me - which are also sung in Spanish. Then there is one instrumental that is really groovy. enjoy!\n\n\nSHARING IS CARING.
