What's that? To listen to messages of soul with a solid beat, make you move your feet. Now the premise of the album is to find a passing spaceship and get rescued by it. Oh, come on. Now the premise of this album is, well, the dance, actually, dance business. The highest definition ever achieved in recording. I'll even tell you what two of the secret ingredients are: pure electronic modern electronics. That'll make 'em happy! Oh, look at 'em, they want to get up and dance! Let's have a party, we gonna go swinging! I'm gon' fuck the whole world up!
