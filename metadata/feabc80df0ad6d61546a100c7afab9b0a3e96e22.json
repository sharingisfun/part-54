This is a fans&amp;#039; album, to be sure, but for fans, the never-before-heard demos (like &quot;Burning Sky&quot; and &quot;Thick As Thieves&quot;) have a certain spine-tingling effect, and the covers (like &quot;So Sad About Us,&quot; &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing,&quot; and &quot;Disguises&quot;) are undeniably fun -- often more so than the covers they chose to include on the proper albums. Extras is not a good introduction, to be sure, but for the converted, this is essential.\n\n\n\n\n01.
