A few years later he gets released and discovers it was a setup. Soon afterwards his wife (Olga Carlatos of ZOMBIE) is gunned down. His old boss (Martin Balsam) seems to be the guilty one and Guido sets out on a mission of revenge! Also involved in the case is a beautiful club disco dancer (Barbara Bouchet).\n\nAnother great, violent crime thriller by master Fernando Di Leo. This may be underrated but will certainly please fans his work. Apart from an all-star cast, BLOOD AND DIAMONDS also features a blasting score by Luis Bacalov (CALIBER 9, THE BOSS) that was later heard in Bruno Mattei&amp;#039;s HELL OF THE LIVING DEAD!\n\nAbove average (DiLeo) crime film., 3 December 2003\n\nAuthor: Sorsimus from Kaarina, Finland \n\nJust released ex- convict Guido watches his girlfriend get killed on the way home from prison. He thinks the killing is connected with the events that led to him going to jail five years back. Guido starts to investigate...\n\nIn many ways a typical late DiLeo- crime film: unimaginative lightning, boring sets, unimpressive action sequences. Yet I think just because of the grittiness of the script, this one easily rises above the other DiLeo- turkeys I&amp;#039;ve seen.\n\nDecent acting in the form of especially Barbara Bouchet and Guido&amp;#039;s main adversary Martin Balsam, who stand out positively. Most importantly, the plot really thickens towards the end climaxing in a truly memorable final scene between Guido and Martin Balsam&amp;#039;s Rizzo.\n\nReleased on video in Finland in the eighties.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ab7ec72040e17acedb51210a9e2a61ef88a4cbb","amp;dn":"Fernando+Di+Leo%60s+BLOOD+AND+DIAMONDS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ab7ec72040e17acedb51210a9e2a61ef88a4cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,183,236,114,4,14,23,172,237,181,18,16,169,226,166,30,248,138,76,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
