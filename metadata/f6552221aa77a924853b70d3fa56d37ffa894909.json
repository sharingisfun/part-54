They mostly rhyme in English and the             \nbeats are melodic and fresh, with some cutting here &amp;amp;        \nthere. Believe me this album puts a lot of North             \nAmerican and European crews to shame. Thanks to one          \nof my oldest pals on the net and my man in Iceland,          \nTony Danza, much props for sharing this.
