Writers Matt Anderson and Eric Hutchins make a very convincing character out of Charlie. This kid is me at that age.\n\nWhen Charlie is brave enough to enter an abandoned farmhouse all alone, he is rewarded with a real treasure, the dream of every kid who walks the earth. What he finds seems to be a sophisticated remote control, and without caring about any consequences, he just takes it home.\n\nAnd then he pushes the red buttonÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦\n\nNever, ever push a red button. It&amp;#039;s sure trouble coming your way.\n\n[IMG]http://img516.imageshack.us/img516/6997/white1ob3.jpg[/IMG]\n\n\nThanks to all the scanners involved.\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE BOOK, THEN BUY THE COMICS OR THE TRADES.
