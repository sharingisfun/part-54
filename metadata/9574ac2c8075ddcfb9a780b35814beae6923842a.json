Funky Nassau Pt. 1 is a real monster, every time you play it the dancefloor litteraly exploads :], Come Down holds it's own as well. The last track When She Made Me Promise is a nice jamming session.\n The nine cuts fuses island rhythms and American jazz/funk into a very nice mixture, featuring guitars, bass, drums, horn section and scratch vocals. Altough they are sometimes misclassified as a disco band, I promise you this is NOT disco hehe.\n\nThis is a vinyl rip, so you might expect some hiss and pops. Although I've tried to clean it up, you can't get all of it out.\n\nenjoy and SEED! :]\n\n/owl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9574ac2c8075ddcfb9a780b35814beae6923842a","amp;dn":"The+Beginning+of+the+End+-+Funky+Nassau+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9574ac2c8075ddcfb9a780b35814beae6923842a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,116,172,44,128,117,221,207,185,167,128,179,88,20,190,174,105,35,132,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
