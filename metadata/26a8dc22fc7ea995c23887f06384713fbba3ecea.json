The movie starts with England divided by faith, Protestant vs. Catholic. The queen, Mary Tudor has no heir and her Catholic supporters fear the succession of her half-sister Elizabeth, a Protestant. They convince the queen to have Elizabeth arrested and put in the Tower of London but the queen hesitates and eventually refuses to sign her death warrant. It is announced that the queen is pregnant but it turns out to be a tumor and she dies of it a while later. Her Catholic supporters are forced to give the throne to Elizabeth. Elizabeth&amp;#039;s first few years are shaky as she is not versed with the art of realpolitik and &quot;rules from the heart instead of the mind&quot;. There is also the question of her succession as she is yet unmarried and her death without heir would mean the throne falling back into Catholic hands. She has many suitors but she eventually rejects them all. And aided by Sir Francis Walsingham she manages to kill all her enemies and ascends the throne as the &quot;Virgin Queen&quot;.\n\nIMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0127536/\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net !\n\nTotal file size: 3.81 GB\n\nTracker URL: http://www.sharego.net:2710/announce\n\nAVInaptic Report:\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: Elizabeth.mkv\nDate: 21/02/2008 08:45:49\nSize: 4,102,029,055 bytes (3912 MB)\n\n[ Generic infos ]\n\nPlay duration: 02:03:32 (7411.883 s)\nContainer type: matroska\nCreation time: 21/02/2008 13:42:47 UTC\nNumber of streams: 5\nType of stream nr. 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (A_AC3) {Main}\nType of stream nr. 3: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)) {Director&amp;#039;s Commentary}\nType of stream nr. 4: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {English Subtitles}\nType of stream nr. 5: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {French Subtitles}\nAudio streams: 2\nMuxing Application: libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\nWriting Application: mkvmerge v2.1.0 (&amp;#039;Another Place To Fall&amp;#039;) built on Dec 31 2007 20:13:50\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 1280 x 688\nWidth: multiple of 32\nHeight: multiple of 16\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution: 1280 x 688\nFrame aspect ratio: 80:43 = 1.860465 (~1.85:1)\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 80:43 = 1.860465 (~1.85:1)\nFramerate: 23.975985 fps\n\n[ Audio track nr. 1 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AC3\nChannels (container): 6\nSample rate: 48000 Hz\nMode: 3 front, 2 rear, 1 LFE\n\n[ Audio track nr. 2 ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nSample rate: 24000 Hz\nOutput sample rate: 48000 Hz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26a8dc22fc7ea995c23887f06384713fbba3ecea","amp;dn":"Elizabeth+HD+720p+SeCtIoN8+%7BSharegoRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26a8dc22fc7ea995c23887f06384713fbba3ecea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,168,220,34,252,126,169,149,194,56,135,240,99,132,113,63,187,163,236,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
