The conclusion? We&amp;#039;re fucked! The mass technological culture is killing the planet and if we are to survive, we have to take a look at the roots of the problem. But also avoid false solutions like alternative or ?green? technology. \n\nThe movie centers around an interview with John Zerzan, anarcho-primitivist \nphilosopher and author who give his view on the problem with civilization \nand what can be done about it. According to him it?s the reality and \nnot ideas that will give way for a paradigm shift. That is, if people are \nprovided with an alternative...  In total the film in its 55 minutes \nis a very welcomed addition to the not so large collection of green anarchist films. \n\nI think as many people as possible should see  it, especially those who are hypnotized by living in the mad machinery of civilization. It&amp;#039;s a slap in the face, an eye opener, a shock; but also inspiring. \nFavorite scenes: riots, making fire with bow-drill,animals jumping...\n\n- Ilmarinen\n\nIf you want to get in touch with Thomas Toivonen regarding this movie you can do it via this email-adress: &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6307060207100c000a06171a230e020a0f4d0c1104&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nFor more info go to http://www.deadsociety.org\t\n\n\nThis movie was filmed by Thomas Toivonen, Vargtassa and Nattsmyg with a digital video camera and two digital cameras in Riddarhyttan, Stockholm and a couple of other places in Sweden.\n\n\nThe movie was edited by Thomas Toivonen on his computer.
