It then leaked out to Softpedia and many other websites. However, Microsoft has shut down or warned many of them, if not all, and to find a download for this beta was virtually impossible. The download at Softpedia has also been removed. That's why we have decided to upload this. \n\n--------------------------------------\n\n**UPDATE!**\n\nMicrosoft has officially launched a more updated and stable version on their site. Download here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://download.live.com/messenger&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://download.live.com/messenger&lt;/a&gt;\n\n=========================\nWindows Live Messenger 9\n=========================\n\nWindows Live Messenger 9 beta now is available for download, less than one month from the Official Release of WLM version 8.5, Softpedia has made available the leaked version of Windows Live messenger 9; the latest version of Windows Live Messenger from Microsoft.\n\nIt?s the next-generation MSN Messenger.
