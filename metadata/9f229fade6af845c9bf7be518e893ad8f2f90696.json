This is the format that my uploads will take on from now on. Embeded subtitles will not show up in vlc and for them to work in media player you will need to use the divx icon in your task bar to change between different subtitles and audio tracks, but they will automaticaly show up in divx player. If you stream this to your ps3 you can change audio and subtitle tracks with the menu brought up with the triangle button. Since I stream all my media to my ps3 I find this format extremely useful so I hope you guys like it as well.
