Something is watching. In Cardiff&amp;#039;s secret heart, the members of the Torchwood team struggle to define and locate the intruder, and contain it before anyone gets hurt. But this time, they are out of their depth. How do you unlock a secret that can&amp;#039;t be broken? How do you assess the facts when the facts change to cover all traces? How do you cope if people are already hurt and no one realises it? What do you do if you&amp;#039;re one of them? The Border Princes are watching, and they play for keeps...This title features characters from BBC&amp;#039;s &quot;Torchwood&quot;, as played by John Barrowman, Eve Myles, Naoko Mori, Burn Gorman and Gareth David-Lloyd. This is an abridged audiobook of the novel by Dan Abnett.\n\nRunning Time - 3 Hours, 30 Minutes, 32 Seconds\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8461743767ca60550e5e7bf87112842fa6287b9c","amp;dn":"Torchwood+-+Border+Princes+-+iPod+Audiobook","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8461743767ca60550e5e7bf87112842fa6287b9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,97,116,55,103,202,96,85,14,94,123,248,113,18,132,47,166,40,123,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
