Lama Norbu and his fellow monks believe they have found a candidate of Dorje\\&amp;#039;s reincarnation within a boy named Jesse Conrad (Alex Wiesendanger) in Seattle. While Jesse is fascinated with the monks and their way of life, his parents, Dean (Chris Isaak) and Lisa (Bridget Fonda), are wary, and that wariness turns into near-hostility when Norbu announces that he would like to take Jesse back with him to Bhutan to be tested. His father changes his mind however, after the death of one of his close friends, seeming to realize that there could be more to life than work and money. Dean, the father, decides to go to Bhutan with Jesse. In Nepal, two children who are also candidates are encountered, Raju (Rajuh Lal) and Gita (Greishma Makar Singh).\n\nIn the story, the Lama Norbu relates the story of Buddha, which is also enacted as a story within the story. In the story, a Hindu Prince called Siddhartha embarks on a journey to attain enlightenment and is viewed by the children in the Story. Mara, a jealous demon, senses that Siddhartha (Keanu Reeves) is about to attain enlightenment and sends his daughters to distract him. Failing to do so, he attempts to shatter SiddharthaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s resolve and thus begins an onslaught of threats, intimidation and temptation. Mara summons a terrifying horde of monsters of every conceivable description but even something as horrific as this still leaves Siddhartha unmoved, unperturbed. Instead he transforms the weapons which these hosts threw at him into lotus petals which exude a lovely fragrance as they gently floated down to earth. Mara decides that Siddhartha will not deny himself and turns into his image in a reflection on a pool of water. Instead Siddhartha reaches and pulls the image out of the water. The classic Buddhist dialogue between Mara and Siddhartha takes place:\n\nMara: \\&quot;You who go where others dare not; Will you be my God? The architect of my house?\\&quot; Siddhartha: \\&quot;Finally I meet the illusion of self; Your evil house will not be built again.\\&quot; Mara: \\&quot;But you live in me; I am your house.\\&quot; Siddhartha: \\&quot;O, trickster; phantom of my own ego, you are pure illusion. You, self, do not exist. The earth is my witness to this Supreme Enlightenment.\\&quot;\n\nLama Norbu explains that Siddhartha defeated an army of demons, simply through his observance of patience and tolerance. He achieved great peacefulness and compassion, through self-detachment from illusions.\n\nIn the end, it is found that all three children are reincarnations of the Lama Dorje - representing his body, mind, and speech. Lama Norbu enters meditation passing away soon after, and a funeral for him is held.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87b178a363bf51723f0f1e3ddf47ca4090469259","amp;dn":"Little+Buddha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87b178a363bf51723f0f1e3ddf47ca4090469259","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,177,120,163,99,191,81,114,63,15,30,61,223,71,202,64,144,70,146,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
