I have included installation instructions for setting the games up quickly and easily.\n\nMy main reason for including the translation packs and the alternate soundtracks are because the page that they were originally hosted on seems to be down.\n\nThe patches for the game are included to, just leave them in the same dir as the English patch installers and they will install when you patch the game (the patches will also add the necessary registry information to your system to make it think it was installed normally)\n\nRead the &quot;READ THIS FIRST-How To Install.txt&quot; file to get it set up\n\nAlternate soundtracks are included in the &quot;Optional&quot; folder.\n\nEnjoy my first torrent contribution ever!\n\n-Reiver","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39a98247241ce309f4b33740bf83158a6d1647d0","amp;dn":"Ys+1+%26+2+Complete+%5BENG%2C+Latest+Patches%2C+Optional+Files+Incl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39a98247241ce309f4b33740bf83158a6d1647d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,169,130,71,36,28,227,9,244,179,55,64,191,131,21,138,109,22,71,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
