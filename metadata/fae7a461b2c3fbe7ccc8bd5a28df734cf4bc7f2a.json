Anyway its a good movie , pretty cool fighting scenes. I didnt find an english subtitled version only german subs but i removed them from the file so now its Japanese only. I guess you will find english or other subs somewhere****\n\n\n\n\n\nThis story comes from the Japanese manga (graphic novel) called &quot;Basilisk,&quot; and is heavily edited from it. They cut out half the characters for the sake of easy and time. Although unfortunate, I agree that they had to do it, and they did a good job of making a &quot;short&quot; movie plot out of long series. The special effects are breathtaking. They must have combined computer animation, and paid attention to every little detail down to making the eyes shine and reflect light in the two main characters when they&amp;#039;re talking. I liken it to House of Flying Daggers or one of those Chinese flicks that are beautiful and have a lot of attention to detail. I love how they managed the occasional slow motion scenes. The acting is top notch. I hate love stories but I took to this one. It&amp;#039;s not all love, and the action scenes are well choreographed and exciting. Ninjas fight, but they&amp;#039;re not the kind of ninjas to be clothed in black jumpers with masks. The &quot;special abilities&quot; don&amp;#039;t look corny or contrived, which impressed me.\n\n\n\nEnjoy\n\nLGLuX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fae7a461b2c3fbe7ccc8bd5a28df734cf4bc7f2a","amp;dn":"Shinobi.Heart.Under.Blade.DVDRIP.JAP-LGLuX.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fae7a461b2c3fbe7ccc8bd5a28df734cf4bc7f2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,231,164,97,178,195,251,231,204,200,189,90,40,223,115,76,244,188,127,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
