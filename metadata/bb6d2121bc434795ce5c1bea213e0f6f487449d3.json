HOPEFULLY THIS SHOULD BE OK.  IF YOU FIND THE FOLDER FOR THE PREVIOUS &amp;#039;STUCK&amp;#039; DOWNLOAD AND COPY AND PASTE:  SAHB (Without Alex) - Fourplay [Remastered] 224kbps [Re-seed] IT SHOULD HOPEFULLY PICK UP WHERE THE OTHER ONE LEFT OFF.\n\n\nFourplay is the eighth album by The Sensational Alex Harvey Band, and it was the first album to be made without Alex Harvey. The Sensational Alex Harvey Band were titled as &quot;SAHB (Without Alex)&quot; on the album cover. Alex Harvey was producing another album called &quot;Alex Harvey Presents: The Loch Ness Monster&quot;. &quot;Fourplay&quot; was originally released in 1977 on vinyl, a few bootleg copies were produced which is the only CD release that the album saw, considered by some SAHB fans as next to impossible to find. Even though Alex Harvey is not on the album, he is pictured on the back tied up with string and gagged behind a huge case with &quot;The Sensational Alex Harvey Band&quot; written on it, while in the background the other four members appear to be singing into a microphone, facing away from Alex. This, obviously, relating to the &quot;Without Alex&quot; part of the album.\n\n1 Smouldering \n2 Chase It Into The Night \n3 Shake Your Way To Heaven \n4 Outer Boogie \n5 Big Boy \n6 Pick It Up And Kick It \n7 Love You For A Life Time \n8 Too Much American Pie \n\n\nHugh McKenna - Keyboards, vocals \nChris Glen - Bass guitar \nTed McKenna - Drums (vocals on track 4) \nZal Cleminson - Guitar (vocals on track 5) \n\n\n\n\nCOMMENTS WOULD BE APPRECIATED","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb6d2121bc434795ce5c1bea213e0f6f487449d3","amp;dn":"SAHB+%28Without+Alex%29+-+Fourplay+%5BRemastered%5D+224kbps+%5BRe-seed%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb6d2121bc434795ce5c1bea213e0f6f487449d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,109,33,33,188,67,71,149,206,92,27,234,33,62,15,111,72,116,73,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
