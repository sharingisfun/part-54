Convinced the opera is bad luck she accepts, and becomes the target (in Argento's unmistakable style) of a psychopath - a man she has been dreaming of since childhood.\n\nDirected by Dario Argento\n\nCountry: Italy \nLanguage: Italian / English Dolby 2.0\nSubtitles: English / Italian\nRuntime: 107 min / USA:107 min (director's cut)\n2,35:1 Anamorphic\n\nSpecial Features: \nArgento Biography / Filmography\nPhotogallery\n\nRelease: Arrow Film Distributors www.arrowfilms.co.uk\n\nDVD5-source, nothing ripped or shrunk\n\nNo other subs were included on disc apart from the aforementioned, so there's no point in asking for it.\n\nNormally I would shout &quot;Say no to dubbing&quot; and leave only one audiotrack, but this movie uses both English and Italian, so that just wouldn't be right.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b4695718471570ab0733719ed09f921702de969","amp;dn":"Terror+at+the+Opera+-+Argento+1987","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b4695718471570ab0733719ed09f921702de969","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,70,149,113,132,113,87,10,176,115,55,25,237,9,249,33,112,45,233,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
