Many of you are familiar with Matt?s previous work with the Simpsons and maybe even Life In Hell.  Futurama began on December 31, 1999, when Fry delivers a pizza to a cryogenics lab for someone named ?I.C. Weiner? (a prank). He accidentally gets cryogenically frozen and wakes up one thousand years into the future.  Leela, a one-eyed career officer, runs tests on Fry and was about to install his career chip. Fry is frightened by his permanent career and the process of inserting the chip so he runs off.  Fry has no place to go, so he decides to find his great-great-great-great-great grand nephew, Professor Hubert Fansworth. He mistakes a Suicide Booth for a phone booth, and that?s where he meets a robot named Bender.  Fry and Bender quickly become friends, but Fry?s tour of New New York is cut short when Leela catches up to him. But Fry makes her realize that she?s not happy with her job, so she removes her own career chip.  Now, everyone is jobless and in search of money, so they find Fry?s nephew. The professor doesn?t give them money, but offers them a job working for ?Planet Express,? an intergalactic delivery service.  Each episode is a science fiction adventure. They?ll discover new worlds, and Fry will continually try to get used to the 31st century.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149460/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0149460/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease SEED!!
