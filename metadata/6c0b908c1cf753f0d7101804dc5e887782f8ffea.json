According to the promoter, the band were so stoned\nwhen they arrived that he literally had to help Robert Plant onstage.  Jimmy\nPage allegedly threw a punch at the promoter as he (the promoter) came\noffstage after introducing the band as &quot;The group formerly known as The\nYardbirds,&quot; but was so stoned he missed completely.\n\nAbout 1200 people got to see this show live.  Most of them were there to see\nVanilla Fudge, who had been popular and had several hits that year.  Our\nboys were billed as &quot;Len Zefflin&quot; in print ads.  At least one kind soul\nrecorded it.  Maybe it was the newness, or the insult of irrelevance, or the\nhaze of pot smoke, or the kids on the floor of the gym - there were no\nchairs so that the crowd could gather around the stage.  Whatever caused it,\nthe Hindenburg catches fire on this night and the Zeppelin emerges\nvictorious.  \n\nThe setlist is mainly the first album.  It&amp;#039;s all they&amp;#039;ve got - they&amp;#039;ve been\na band four months.  This is their fifth show in five nights - they&amp;#039;ve\nplayed every night since landing in Denver the day after Christmas.  They&amp;#039;d\nplayed just 22 shows before leaving for America.  The first album wouldn&amp;#039;t\ncome out for two more weeks.\n\nThis is the rawest form.  Led Zeppelin as it began.  Playing in front of\n1200 college kids who got discounted tickets because the student government\nhad a deal with Concerts West.  Gonzaga &amp;#039;68.  The Kennedy Pavilion.
