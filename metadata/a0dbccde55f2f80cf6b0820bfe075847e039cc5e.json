Characters created like Russian characters always - some pretty and some really ugly. Dobrynya Nikitich goes to save duke&amp;#039;s cousin Zabava from a three-head dragon Gorynych. It&amp;#039;s not an easy job for him and his young student Jelissei. But Dobrynya doesn&amp;#039;t know that duke himself stands in a difficult position and is not interested in saving his cousin. Even the famous Russian witch Baba-Jaga comes in to the story. It&amp;#039;s an adventurous story with some good laughs (for example when Khans teeth fly out; Jelissei with a blue eye - his facial expression is really good; Russian working ladies singing a very well performed song and also dancing along with it (they are almost like Russian version of Finnish band VÃƒÂ¤rttinÃƒÂ¤) &amp; when Dobrynya handles the betrayal). It&amp;#039;s still a good animation to watch, although the ending is more than predictable. Overall 6/10 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0dbccde55f2f80cf6b0820bfe075847e039cc5e","amp;dn":"Dobriat+Nikita+i+Zmei+Gorianin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0dbccde55f2f80cf6b0820bfe075847e039cc5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,219,204,222,85,242,248,12,246,176,130,11,254,7,88,71,224,57,204,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
