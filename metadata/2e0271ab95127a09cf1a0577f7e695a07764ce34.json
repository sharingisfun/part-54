Reason 3 comes packed with unique features that will make it a strong alternative to the hardware workstation synthesizer, whether for composing, producing or live playing. \n\nThis is fully functional but be aware of that it is a BETA release. The 20 minute restriction is gone when you apply the patch that is included.\n\nTorrentupdate: Sorry but the patch will not take care of the &quot;not able to save or export anything&quot;-restriction. :-( I hope there will be some crack out soon cause I really like the new mastering equipments in this version of Reason.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e0271ab95127a09cf1a0577f7e695a07764ce34","amp;dn":"Propellerheads+Reason+v3+1+Demo+Beta+incl++20min+patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e0271ab95127a09cf1a0577f7e695a07764ce34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,2,113,171,149,18,122,9,207,26,5,119,247,230,149,160,119,100,206,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
