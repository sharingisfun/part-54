Captured using MPEG-2 (NTSC, 720 X 480, 60 Hz, 4:3) and AC3 compression.\n\n English audio with a little commentary and text in Japanese\n\n Finally a great game played on both ends of the court by both teams. If you wanna see stars who choke (Duncan, Hamilton) and a role player who does it again (Big Shot Rob), then this whopper of an iso image is for you.\n\n Enjoy watching the whole kitten-kaboodle, from Kid Rock to the end of overtime.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7deff4d774f4ce22b0c619c184c9716dcaf4b31","amp;dn":"2005+NBA+FINALS+PISTONS+SPURS+GAME+5+%28JUNE+19%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7deff4d774f4ce22b0c619c184c9716dcaf4b31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,222,255,77,119,79,76,226,43,12,97,156,24,76,151,22,220,175,75,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
