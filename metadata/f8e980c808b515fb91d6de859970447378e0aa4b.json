Saul follows his standard theme: a group of dangerous young people must be destroyed for the world to be safe. The story \nbegins with Julie falling victim to a strain of bees whose venom is unusually toxic. \nThe man who developed the bees, and their antitoxin, is a serial killer. \nNot wanting Julie to survive, he switches the antitoxin for an untried substance \nthat turns out to be a new species of insect that requires a mammalian host for \nsurvival. Julie survives, infested with internal insects, and spews them forth to \ninfect her friends. The horror of her condition is thoroughly detailed. Saul also\ngives us a splendidly creepy bug-infested house of horrors and a fitting revenge for\nthe villain. Not for the weak of stomach...\n\n--------------------------------------------\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\n\n\n[More John Saul Audiobooks on the way..]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8e980c808b515fb91d6de859970447378e0aa4b","amp;dn":"The+Homing+-+John+Saul+%5BAudiobook%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8e980c808b515fb91d6de859970447378e0aa4b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,233,128,200,8,181,21,251,145,214,222,133,153,112,68,115,120,224,170,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
