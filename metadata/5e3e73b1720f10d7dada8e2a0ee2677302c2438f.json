Did you think I was done with the classic DJ sets?  Hell NO!\n\nLet&amp;#039;s go back to 1989 when DJ services were off to a great start and remixing music into dance hits was key to making a song even more of a hit...\n\nThis DJ service didn&amp;#039;t last long... started in 1989 and closed in 1993.  But - worthwhile listening from some great artists!\n\nI have another one in my computer somewhere - I will post another time.  In the meantime - dance!\n\nPlaylist:\n\n1.
