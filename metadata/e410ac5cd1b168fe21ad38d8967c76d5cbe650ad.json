Vocalist and guitarist Charles Gearheart (aka Richie Hart) spent his childhood \\&quot;up Goose Creek Hollow\\&quot; in Floyd County, KY, and when he put together his good-time country-rock group, he drew upon his home\\&amp;#039;s rich musical heritage as well as its name. In 1970, Gearheart and a group of local studio musicians assembled a handful of songs and presented them to Capitol Records. Capitol signed his project, forcing Gearheart to assemble a touring group. Banjo player and fiddler Fred Wise was brought in to compliment existing guitarists Paul Spradlin (listed as \\&quot;Paul Howard\\&quot; on the album), Bob Henke (\\&quot;Williard\\&quot;), Mike McFadden (following the breakup of his psychedelic group Superfine Dandelion), as well as a rotating cast of bassists and drummers.\n\nWith a sound very similar to what the Band was doing at the same time, Goose Creek Symphony were rock &amp; rollers who played a very faithful brand of country music, all the while layering rhythms and harmonies along the same lines as Buffalo Springfield and the Grateful Dead. They released albums through the mid-\\&amp;#039;70s, with that streak ending in a long hiatus from 1976 to 1990, when the group decided to re-form and record again.\n\nTheir marriage of earthy instrumentation and easygoing vibes have been able to give the group a longevity. Into their third decade, Goose Creek Symphony is drawing strong groups of fans to their summer festival appearances, similar to what the Dead and Jimmy Buffett have known.\n\n\n \nWords Of Earnest\n\n \n\nCharles Gearheart \\&quot;Charlie\\&quot; - lead vocal, acoustic guitar\nPaul Spradlin \\&quot;Pearl\\&quot; - electric guitar, vocals\nBob Henke \\&quot;Willard\\&quot; - vocals, guitar, bass\nPat Moore \\&quot;Froggy\\&quot; - bass\nFred Weisz \\&quot;Flying Fred\\&quot; - fiddle\nJim Tolles \\&quot;Cactus Jim\\&quot; - fiddle\nChris Lockheart \\&quot;Flash\\&quot; - drums\nHarold Williams - horns\nRandall Bramblett - horns\n\nTRACKS\nGearheart &amp; God (2:43)\nMe &amp; Him (2:50)\nWords Of Ernest (5:30)\nRush On Love (2:40)\n(Oh Lord Won\\&amp;#039;t You Buy Me A) Mercedes Benz (2:55)\nGuitars Pickin\\&amp;#039;, Fiddles Playin\\&amp;#039;, Orange Blossom Special (4:10)\nWhupin\\&amp;#039; It (3:10)\nSpeakin\\&amp;#039; Of (5:10)\nBroken Creek Goose Down (2:15)\nThe Gospel (2:25)\n\n\nWRITER CREDITS\n\nArtist Tracks\nCharles R.
