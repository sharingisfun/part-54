Even if they are still leaning quite heavily on old material, it's generally songs that are less familiar to a non-Senegalese audience, often shedding light on their roots and influences. They're also revamped with a more zestful, live-in-the-studio feel, the band is beefed up by extra brass and percussion, and the new compositions are pure, vintage Baobab.\n\nAs ever, their foremost instrumental star is lead guitarist BarthÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©lemy Attisso, whose fluid but never florid licks continuously percolate through the music, occasionally emerging for exquisitely timed solo spots, as on &quot;Aline&quot; - a lovely relaxed tribute to Congolese rumba - and, more grittily on &quot;NdÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©leng NdÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©leng&quot;. A driving piece based on the mbalax rhythm, it also features a strong lead vocal from the youngest of their five singers, Assane Mboup. If he sounds a bit like Youssou N'Dour, that's maybe because he's one of N'dour's protÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©s, and the two trade verses brilliantly on '&quot;Nijaay&quot;.\n\nPraise should also go to Issa Cissoko, who decorates his own gorgeously smoochy calypso &quot;Bikowa&quot; with an utterly beseeching solo. And what about percussionist Mountaga Koite, whose deft, insistent cymbal work powers the likes of &quot;Ami Kita Bay&quot; and &quot;Colette&quot;? I could go on. The latter closes the album on a slightly unusual note - blending reggae, '70s soul and a dash of boogaloo into something like Senegalese ska. Yes, that is the Buena Vista Social Club's Jesus 'Aguaje' Ramos on trombone, but thereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢??s no falling into the trap of gratuitous celebrity cameos. How could there be when Orchestra Baobab have so many outstanding talents of their own?\n-- Jon Lusk &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/fn9x/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/fn9x/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTracks\n1- Pape Ndiaye\n2- Nijdaay\n3- Beni Baraale\n4- Ami Kita Bay\n5- Cabral\n6- Sibam\n7- Aline\n8- Ndeleng Ndeleng\n9- Jirim\n10- Bikowa\n11- Colette\n\nArtwork (300dpi scan) included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy and seed!\n\nPastafari &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/pastafari/&lt;/a&gt;\nProud Member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://venganza.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://venganza.org&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9b7c9359ca764917e5e1c8a247ea9f9e6bd5cda","amp;dn":"Orchestra+Baobab+-+Made+In+Dakar+%5BFLAC%5D+TQMP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9b7c9359ca764917e5e1c8a247ea9f9e6bd5cda","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,183,201,53,156,167,100,145,126,94,28,138,36,126,169,249,230,189,92,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
