This was NOT developed by Darki_AleX or Team M33, but this was based off of their releases.\n\nscreen : http://img.qj.net/uploads/articles_module/118993/custom-firmware-3-93-psp-mac-address.jpg\n\nAnd here is a video of this firmware in action:\nYoutube video :\n\n\nCustom Firmware 3.93 features:\n\n    * Uses the 3.93 kernel\n    * Implemented all the original custom firmware features.\n    * Ability to use the normal recovery inside the XMB by pressing the HOME button:\n          o When in the recovery, the system is suspended, and you can change all options directly.\n          o All options work immediately, there is no need to reboot (even the Slim\\\\\\&amp;#039;s USB charging option)\n          o Ability to make a Pandora battery from the recovery, read and restore the EEPROM, etc. Providing that the motherboard supports it.\n    * Ability to hide the MAC address in System Information, if you do so, the MAC will show visually as all 0\\\\\\&amp;#039;s.\n    * Ability to save the savegames in normal format, rather then encrypted (only functions in March33 and Sony NP9960 mode).\n    * The native 3.93 pops isn\\\\\\&amp;#039;t as good as the previous pops, therefor I hope the popsloader will get updated to support 3.93.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e67b7602866743cddd28f955612cc66aa745dc9","amp;dn":"Custom+Firmware+3.93+%2B+kernel+1.50","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e67b7602866743cddd28f955612cc66aa745dc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,103,183,96,40,102,116,60,221,210,143,149,86,18,204,102,170,116,93,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
