Previous discs are available on TPB.\n\nAtmosphere is a &quot;Dream Synth&quot; ROMpler instrument with a superb soundbank of 3.4GB of synth leads, pads and basses. It&amp;#039;s one of my favourite synth plug-ins because it has so many excellent sounds and the clear GUI makes it very easy to use.\n\nThe retail version is provided on 6 CD-ROMs. I&amp;#039;ve posted each one separately in the past couple of days.\n\nA keygen was included with Disc 1. An update to version 2.1 is included in this pack, along with installation instructions.\n\nThe update is included in a RAR file and should enable the synth to be used with Pro Tools, and also enables syncing the VSTi&amp;#039;s LFOs to your sequencer host.\n\nI hope you have a problem-free installation and enjoy this synth. Thanks for seeding!\n\n--\nArty - &quot;Just don&amp;#039;t ask for all 56 Gigs of Omnisphere!&quot;\n22nd February 2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:64e35392cd29e1fbc3769357f69e3a35aa9da31c","amp;dn":"ArtyTorrent+Pack+82-Spectrasonics+Atmosphere+VSTi+Disc+6%2Bupdate","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"64e35392cd29e1fbc3769357f69e3a35aa9da31c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,227,83,146,205,41,225,251,195,118,147,87,246,158,58,53,170,157,163,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
