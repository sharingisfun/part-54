Whitley Strieber, on Dreamland:\n- http://www.unknowncountry.com/ -\n\nYear: September 15th 2007\nDuration: 1:13:29\nBit rate: 32kbps .mp3 format\nSize: 16.8mb\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSaturday September 15th, 2007 \n\nWar in Dreamland!\n\n\nThis week we feature a rarity--an argument. It&amp;#039;s between Whitley Strieber and Daniel Pinchbeck about what the human future is likely to hold. It is the first time that an argument had broken out on Dreamland, but the suggestion that Whitley Strieber is in league with alien presences that don?t have the best interests of the human species at heart lit Mr. Strieber?s fuse, big time. For us, the result is an intense and revealing discussion as Pinchbeck accuses Strieber of encouraging disaster by having a ?negative? view of the future and Strieber accuses Pinchbeck of preferring a fantasy that seeks to ignore the laws of nature. \n\nNevertheless, both men know a tremendous amount about where we are and where we are likely to be going, and the heat of their discussion reveals their passion for their ideas in ways that you seldom hear. \n\nThis is a not-to-be missed Dreamland, and a rare chance to hear anger in Whitley Strieber?s voice, not to mention that of Daniel Pinchbeck. Even so, the information that sparks back and forth between them is amazing and extremely valuable, and would not be there had it not been for the friction. (Or is that too mild a word? ?Battle royal? is probably the better description.) \n\nDon&amp;#039;t miss Daniel Pinchbeck&amp;#039;s website, http://www.RealitySandwich.com/\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDaniel Pinchbeck&amp;#039;s response to 09-15-07 Dreamland program: \n\n- http://us.penguingroup.com/static/html/blogs/alien-dreamtime-my-fight-whitley-strieber-daniel-pinchbeck\n\nWhitley Strieber&amp;#039;s response to 09-15-07 Dreamland program:\n\n- http://www.unknowncountry.com/journal/?id=300\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTorrent compiled and uploaded by geogaddi00 () to:\n\nUtopiated - http://utopiated.net/ (part of Exopolitics UK: http://exopolitics.org.uk/ )\nConspiracy Central - http://conspiracycentral.net:6969/\nThe Pirate Bay - http://thepiratebay.se/\nalt.binaries.ufo.files a.b.paranormal a.b.conspiracy a.b.multimedia\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3852e4b5c5567860de5cfe7dd5e56a81577ede38","amp;dn":"Daniel+Pinchbeck+VS.+Whitley+Strieber+-+2012%3A+Transformation+or+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3852e4b5c5567860de5cfe7dd5e56a81577ede38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,82,228,181,197,86,120,96,222,92,254,125,213,229,106,129,87,126,222,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
