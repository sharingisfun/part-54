Despite not really &quot;making it big,&quot; their songs were featured in a bunch of soundtracks...  Their &quot;Peppyrock&quot; video was certainly memorable for featuring Sesame Street-style characters - check that out at Youtube if you need a reminder.\n\n1.Corncob Pipe\n2.Beats Don't Stop\n3.Things Gotta Change\n4.Peppyrock\n5.Superchile\n6.Road Trip\n7.Rigamarole\n8.Cog\n9.Boilermaker\n10.Bad Trip\n11.BTK\n\n...a final note: Although I once owned this album, it was stolen, never to be recovered.  So, years of searching P2P networks finally got me each track of this wonderful album.  The quality is alright considering a few had to be uncooked, unconverted, and re-converted to the 128kbps MP3s they are now.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:685a873384e02464f9e37228bc5808b2d0a4bbe5","amp;dn":"BTK+-+Birth+Through+Knowledge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"685a873384e02464f9e37228bc5808b2d0a4bbe5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,90,135,51,132,224,36,100,249,227,114,40,188,88,8,178,208,164,187,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
