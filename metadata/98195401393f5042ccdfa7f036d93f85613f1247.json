For instance uTorrent shows that there's three(!) seeders on every torrent I upload when they've been published for a few minutes, and I have shared maybe 1% of the file. How's that possible? A month ago it showed &quot;only&quot; two..\n\nThe people who hate what I do block my listening port and slows down my bandwidth to an extreme low, and I'm being bombarded in comments on uploads and mails. The only thing I can do, is to appeal to you who are Christians, to help me seed these torrents, because I don't know how much longer I'm able to do this. Not for long, I fear. And I live in Norway, a so called &quot;free Nation&quot; of the western world..\nAnd then I'm accused of being a &quot;conspiracy-theorist&quot;.. :-)\n\nNow to this upload. I have found Bob Dylan's Christian albums are often missing in otherwise &quot;complete&quot; Discography-torrents about the man, with the exception of &quot;Slow Train Coming&quot;, presumably because of the hits from that album.\n\n&quot;Saved&quot;, on the other hand, I had to look long and hard to find, and also &quot;Shot Of Love&quot;\nI find that remarkable, but understandable.\n\n&quot;Slow Train..&quot; is a great album, and it does include many great tracks. I like it. &quot;Gotta Serve Somebody&quot; &quot;Slow Train&quot;, &quot;When He Returns&quot; and especially the song &quot;I believe in You&quot; stand out as radical testimonies of his newfound treasure..\n\nBut my personal favorite is the album &quot;Saved&quot;, on which one great song follows another.\nOn &quot;What can I do for You&quot;, Dylan plays the most beautiful, tender sounds on his harmonica.\n&quot;Saved&quot;, &quot;Covenant Woman&quot;, &quot;Saving Grace&quot;; they're all great tracks. But the world in general doesn't seem to think so..?\nMy advice is to listen in silence, starting from track no. 1, and see what happens..\n\n&quot;Shot Of Love&quot; is an acquired taste, I feel. Don't know if I can tell you more than that. If you like it, you like it. &quot;Property Of Jesus&quot; though, is a wake up call for those who mock Christians, and has strong lyrics.. Hopefully even that album will draw the listener closer to Jesus, but if that's what you desperately want (and it should be..?), I'd go for &quot;Saved&quot; .. :-)\n\nBest wishes from\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;740211061d121d061119151d18341319151d185a171b19&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98195401393f5042ccdfa7f036d93f85613f1247","amp;dn":"Bob+Dylan%5C%27s+Christian+Albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98195401393f5042ccdfa7f036d93f85613f1247","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,25,84,1,57,63,80,66,204,223,167,240,54,217,63,133,97,63,18,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
