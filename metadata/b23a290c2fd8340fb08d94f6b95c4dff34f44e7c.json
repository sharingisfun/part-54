I like movies that shove it in your face and make you deal with it...movies like, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;...no clichÃƒÂ©s, no touching moments, just brutal, bitter realism. &quot;Training Day&quot; was such a movie. However, the one thing that made this film really shine was the performance by Mr. Washington. To me, a good actor is someone who just IS a character...if it isn&amp;#039;t obvious that they are acting than they are doing a good job. That was the case with Washingon. He just was Alonzo. Every pantomime, every word, every glance was performed masterfully. Did Mr. Washington deserve his Oscar? Absolutely. 200%. Some people say, &quot;not Oscar material&quot; and I must wonder, what film...what performance were they watching?\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b23a290c2fd8340fb08d94f6b95c4dff34f44e7c","amp;dn":"Training+Day+%5BDVDRip%5DEng%5BOryoN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b23a290c2fd8340fb08d94f6b95c4dff34f44e7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,58,41,12,47,216,52,15,176,141,148,246,185,92,77,255,52,244,78,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
