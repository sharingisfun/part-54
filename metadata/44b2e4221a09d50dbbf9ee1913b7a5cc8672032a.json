Adventure has a new name.\n\nMaster explorer and former US Navy Seal Dirk Pitt and his wisecracking buddy Al Giordino goes on the adventure of a lifetime of seeking out a lost Civil War ironclad battleship known as the &quot;Ship of Death&quot; that protects a secret cargo is lost somewhere in the deserts of West Africa. But while the two cross paths with a beautiful and brilliant U.N. scientist Dr. Eva Rojas who is being hounded by a ruthless dictator. She believes that the hidden treasure may be connected to a larger problem that threatens the world around them. Hunting for a ship that no one else thinks exists, Dirk, Al, and Eva must rely on their wits and their daring heroics to outsmart dangerous warlords, survive the threatening terrain, and get to the bottom of both mysteries\nWritten by Anthony Pereyra\n\n\nC O M M E N T S\n\nFinally a family-friendly action movie, 11 September 2005\n\nAuthor: tracery from United States \n\nI was pleasantly surprised to see how fun, fast-paced and witty this non-R rated movie came out. Beautiful scenery and Indiana Jones-like action mixed with humor and drama. Great film. I wish there were more films like this that lack the need for explicit sex, violence, drugs or swearing to get noticed. I believe strongly in movies that contain the aforementioned elements and are for adults; it&amp;#039;s just sad to see few family films that don&amp;#039;t involve animated cookie-cutter characters. Nice jobs by both Zahn and Cruz. The supporting characters were likable and not too clichÃƒÂ©. Admittedly Zahn has fallen into a role of the crazy side-kick, but in this film I think he finally finds the balance of kooky and serious in the way a action movie &quot;buddy&quot; should. \n\n\nBE AWARE OF BOGUS SITES AND LAMERS\n\nENJOY!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44b2e4221a09d50dbbf9ee1913b7a5cc8672032a","amp;dn":"Sahara%5B2005%5DDvDrip%5B720x436%5DAC3%5B6ch%5D%5BEng%5D-RHooD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44b2e4221a09d50dbbf9ee1913b7a5cc8672032a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,178,228,34,26,9,213,13,187,249,238,25,19,183,165,204,134,114,3,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
