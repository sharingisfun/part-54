Geist are a German band, and this is their second lethal dose of evil Black Metal. I am wary, these days, of new BM bands who pop up all over the landscape, as so many of them are just trend-hoppers, but I am glad to find that Geist are the real deal.\n\nVicious, heavy Black Metal with a lot of melody and a touch or two of Teutonic folk influence is what you will find here. Geist have that characteristic heavy sound that German BM bands can&amp;#039;t seem to avoid, and they pack a lot of aggression into their sharp, rather technical riffage. Vocals are the expected rasp, and the whole is a sound somewhere between Astriaal and maybe some of the newer Marduk stuff. What makes Geist stand out from the crowd is their absolute conviction, and the authority they wield when transitioning from heavy to melodic and from blasty to slow. The difference between &amp;#039;dull&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;ominous&amp;#039; is all attitude and confidence, and Geist have that in spades.\n\nOverall Geist are not breaking any new ground, but they are very, very good at what they do, and any fans of German Black Metal should check them out without hesitating. Geist are fierce and complex, and they have real mastery over their craft. Recommended.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=36243&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=36243&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEAC Lame 3.97 v0 VBR with log","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:158fbda6963a20aed4e28776e99e545455c01d19","amp;dn":"Geist+%282006%29+-+Kainsmal+%2AGerman+Melodic+BM%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"158fbda6963a20aed4e28776e99e545455c01d19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,143,189,166,150,58,32,174,212,226,135,118,233,158,84,84,85,192,29,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
