Install the application using trillian-v4.0a-current.exe\n2. Once the installation is done close the program\n3. Run patch.exe and select the main trillian.exe (should be in &lt;install dir&gt;trillian.exe)\n4. You may also optionally remove some ASTRA network nags by clicking next in the patcher and selecting astra.dll (should be in &lt;install dir&gt;pluginsastra.dll). The patch fools trillian into believing that you are infact connected to the ASTRA network, but in reality you aren&amp;#039;t\n5. Enjoy the program!\n\n-Cracked by Homer\n\n\n\nOfficial Release notes\n\n\nBuild 80\n\nBuild 80 is now available.  As some of you have noticed, we?re taking a little more time with our builds lately - the end result is more bugfixes, more of our energy focused on stabilizing and improving our codebase, and a chance to finalize some of the features we?ve been holding off on for a while.\n\nThis week?s build includes:\n\n    * Yahoo webcam support.  When viewing the webcam of a friend, we place the video in a floating ?webcam? window; this is a minor change from 3.1 and more compatible with Yahoo?s method of floating webcam windows.\n    * New Add Contact Window.  Adding contacts is starting to get more and more complicated in terms of the questions we need to ask the user; our new window reflects this and should hopefully take us many versions into the future.\n    * HTTP tunneling for Yahoo. In the rare case when your only path to Yahoo?s servers is through actual HTTP connections, Trillian can now tunnel as necessary.\n    * Improved color support for Yahoo. We never realized Yahoo supported more than a few basic colors for formatting.  Whoops.  Your messages to Yahoo contacts should now be sent more accurately.\n    * Automatic web login for MySpace connections.\n    * Over 100 changelog entries, including features and bugfixes.
