It&amp;#039;s about teenagers going to a summer camp by the lake to get killed in gruesome ways by some mysterioues killer. But for some reason this one has been stuck in my head since I saw it in the 80s. \n\nIt&amp;#039;s not just the famous twist ending, it&amp;#039;s something about the whole movie that makes it unique in a really worn out genre. The bad acting almost makes it feel like everything is for real.\n\nAnyway, I know this one is out on both R1 and R2 DVDs, so if you after best possible quality you should go for some other torrent (or buy it on DVD). This is rip directly from the swedish rentaltape on VHS, and it&amp;#039;s been watching many times to there is some disturbance sometimes. I just fell that the vhs tape and the swedish subtitles went along pretty well with the feeling I get from the movie.\n\nEnjoy!\n\nCover:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i222.photobucket.com/albums/dd222/sunserious/Transworld-SleepawayCamp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i222.photobucket.com/albums/dd222/sunserious/Transworld-SleepawayCamp.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIMDB info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086320/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086320/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck my other uploads for more vhs rips of hard-to-find-movies!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:145200f7a5ea134027ab5c5164b398373de848fc","amp;dn":"Sleepaway.Camp.1983.PAL.SWESub.VHSRip.XviD-Sunserious.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"145200f7a5ea134027ab5c5164b398373de848fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,82,0,247,165,234,19,64,39,171,92,81,100,179,152,55,61,232,72,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
