The musical is loosely based on the Book of Genesis. Act I tells the story of Adam and Eve, Cain, and Abel, and Act II deals with Noah and the Flood. While using the Bible as a plot source, it freely deviates in many details, and is a story of parents and children without a specifically religious point-of-view. Though it had a very short run on London&amp;#039;s West End and has never played Broadway, the show is extremely popular in community theatres worldwide. The show uses the same principals in both acts, with the actors each taking on a different character for the story of Noah.\n\nChildren of Eden, musical play \nComposed by Stephen Schwartz \nPerformed by Bruce Coughlin \nwith Ann Teehan-Mendoker, William Solo, Charles Paashaus, James Anthony Johnson, Zina Goldrich, Emy Baysic, Kelli Rabke, Barry Cavanagh, Adrian Zmed, Stephanie Mills, Jim Weaver, John O&amp;#039;Neil, Ann Bass, Vicki Carter, Vincent D&amp;#039;Elia, Sheetal Gandhi, Dennis Masuzzo, David Strauss, Peter Grant, Angela Garrison, Daniel McMillan, Steven Benson, Darius DeHaas, Hunter Foster, John F.
