The trio of L.A. Latinos has the commercial clout and its raps are mercifully free of the misogyny, homophobia, and anti-Asian, anti-Jewish racism that so often mars the genre. Member/producer D.J. Muggs creates an eerily lean soundscape of whining sirens, off-kilter funk rhythms, metallic percussion, nasal taunts, and gruff warnings that\\&amp;#039;s the aural equivalent of today\\&amp;#039;s nerve-rattling cop flicks and mob movies. \nUp to SKULL &amp; BONES, 1993\\&amp;#039;s BLACK SUNDAY had been Cypress Hill\\&amp;#039;s greatest commercial success, and it\\&amp;#039;s no wonder. The album\\&amp;#039;s funky grooves and mellow but danceable rhythms helpedto expand Cypress Hill\\&amp;#039;s audience, hooking fans of alternative rock as well as earning Cypress Hill props from hip-hop die-hards.\nFourteen solid grooves make up this album fromthe West Coast trio, beginning with the dope anthem \\&quot;I Wanna Get High\\&quot;. \\&quot;Insane in the Brain\\&quot; and \\&quot;I Ain\\&amp;#039;t Goin\\&amp;#039; Out Like That\\&quot; are already hip-hop classics, each featuring the signature rolling bass hooks that defined Cypress Hill\\&amp;#039;s soundbefore the group began experimenting with heavy metal. Deftly culled soul and Latin jazz samples provide a smooth backdrop for the intricate rhythms featured here. Refreshingly intelligent social concerns also find expression, with a tolerance that\\&amp;#039;s rare indeed in the isolationism of rap. BLACK SUNDAY is a delightful departure from the obsession with guns and money that usually taints the West Coast school\\&amp;#039;s output.\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1. I Wanna Get High \t\n2.
