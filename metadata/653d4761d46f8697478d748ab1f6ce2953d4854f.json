Emboldened by the inclusion of its single &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; on the soundtrack to the hit film Daredevil, Fallen debuted at an impressive number seven on Billboard&amp;#039;s Top 40. But &quot;Bring Me to Life&quot; is a bit misleading. A flawless slice of Linkin Park-style anguish pop, it&amp;#039;s actually a duet between Lee and 12 Stones&amp;#039; Paul McCoy. In fact, almost half of Fallen&amp;#039;s 11 songs are piano-driven ballads that suggest Tori Amos if she wore too much mascara and recorded for the Projekt label. The other half of the album does include flashes of the single&amp;#039;s PG-rated nu-metal (&quot;Everybody&amp;#039;s Fool,&quot; &quot;Going Under&quot;). But it&amp;#039;s the symphonic goth rock of groups like Type O Negative that influences most of Fallen. Ethereal synths float above Ben Moody&amp;#039;s crunching guitar in &quot;Haunted,&quot; while &quot;Whisper&quot; even features apocalyptic strings and a scary chorus of Latin voices right out of Carmina Burana. &quot;Tourniquet&quot; is an anguished, urgent rocker driven by chugging guitars and spiraling synths, with brooding lyrics that reference Evanescence&amp;#039;s Christian values: &quot;Am I too lost to be saved?/Am I too lost?/My God! My tourniquet/Return to me salvation.&quot; The song is Fallen&amp;#039;s emotional center point and defines the band&amp;#039;s sound.
