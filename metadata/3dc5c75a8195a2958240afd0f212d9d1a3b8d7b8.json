Video files do not always work, for me the older video files could not convert, but the newer ones do. You must be running iTunes version 7.6.2 (the latest as of writing)and be authorized to play the content you want decrypted.\n\nYou'll need to install Java (http://www.java.com/getjava/) if you want to use the easy to use Java GUI (Graphical User Interface) that is included that can be used on both Windows and Mac machines. Just double click on the Requiem.jar file and the GUI will come up.\n\n===========\nChanges from 1.7.1 to 1.7.2\n- Hopefully Vista works now\n===========\n\nLast release was supposed to fix Vista problems, but it failed.  The changes have been made so it will *hopefully* work on Vista this time.  All I know is that everything is pre-built even for the Mac now.  For PPC users, it works :)\n\n------\nThree last notes to end on:\n\n1. I should probably thank legodude83089 from Demonoid for initially distributing these files. I'm just putting them up here at TPB because it's more popular and registering is not required for downloading.  You can find the same version here:\nAnd of course, I should thank Brahms, the creator of Requiem.\n2. Do NOT share your de-DRM'd iTunes purchases. Why? Requiem does not remove the personal information from your files. Your identity is at stake and Apple could ban your account (at the very least) if caught. \n3. Please share this program as long as possible.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dc5c75a8195a2958240afd0f212d9d1a3b8d7b8","amp;dn":"Requiem+1.7.2+iTunes+DRM+Remover","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dc5c75a8195a2958240afd0f212d9d1a3b8d7b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,197,199,90,129,149,162,149,130,64,175,208,242,18,217,209,163,184,215,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
