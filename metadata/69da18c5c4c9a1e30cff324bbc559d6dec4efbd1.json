Norsk subtitle.\nThis is good quality, \tavc2.0.11.1110  1200 kbs\naudio: AAC-LC 128 kbs: stereo\n\nTrll, that person who knows a better way when source is a DVD and target is lossy. I even bet some couldn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t pick the target from source. Tell me and maybe you win a very good working-station, which is the price in a contest I will arrange may month until I know the winner 28.5 \n\nThe topic is de-encoding with mp4, mkv, XviD and audio compress\nWhy do people still use DivX, some DVD-players has support of DivX in hardware. I had devices removed and if some code for DivX was burnt inn, I don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t stop before erasing it. Is it so insain difficult to code your AV with H264. Use MeGui, extract to wav and code it to NERO.D.A trough your audio-player. Must not be WMP. Don\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t use MS\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s oown code-packet, and stop putting MP3 in videos. USE nero, and if sobe, use vorbis instead of MP3.\nYou must give the file over 300 kbs before MP3 is equal or less with nero 128 kbs\nor 128 kbs vorbis. Going higher is dum, if you dont have 1 TB spair.\nI shal now look at 10 pages in TV-prog, after I can tell you that very few uses the best encoder, the majority use the ever worst: DivX\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69da18c5c4c9a1e30cff324bbc559d6dec4efbd1","amp;dn":"CSI.LV.SE1.EP01.THE.PILOT.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69da18c5c4c9a1e30cff324bbc559d6dec4efbd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,218,24,197,196,201,161,227,12,255,50,75,188,85,157,109,236,78,251,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
