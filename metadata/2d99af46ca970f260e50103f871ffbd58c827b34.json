Our world is so interdependent and so interrelated that peaceful dialogue has become an imperative. In spite of the general erosion of commitment to ÃƒÂ¢??religion,ÃƒÂ¢?? however interpreted or misinterpreted, religion still plays a pivotal role in shaping peopleÃƒÂ¢??s attitudes and influencing their behaviour. In spite of serious instances of abuse of various religions by some of their claimed followers so as to justify or instigate acts of brutality and bloodshed, there are positive and helpful common themes in these religions. Therefore, peaceful and candid intra-faith and inter-faith dialogues are important tools in working for such goals. This video is a humble contribution to that dialogue from one perspective within a major world religion that is the professed faith of nearly one fifth of the human race; one that is more misunderstood than any other faith, sometimes, even, by some of its followers.\n\nThis video examines the nature and parameters of the normative relationship between Muslims and non-Muslims. It is based mainly on an attempt to understand the QurÃƒÂ¢??an in its own textual and historical context.\n\nDr. Jamal Badawi has been without doubt one of the best known Muslim speakers in the West for the last two decades. Dr. Badawi is a professor of economics, at St. Mary&amp;#039;s University, Canada. Dr. Jamal Badawi&amp;#039;s books on Islam and Muslim-Christian issues are quite popular. He is one of the most effective Dawah speakers and has hundreds of lectures and debates on tapes, as well as books and leaflets on various topics. \n\n\nFilename.........: Muslims and Non-Muslims Relations (Misunderstood Qur&amp;#039;anic Texts)\nRuntime......: 1:07:33\nVideo Codec..: MPEG-1 \nVideo Bitrate: 1150 kbps\nAspect Ratio.: 352x288 (1.333)\nFramerate....: 25.000 fps\nAudio Codec..:  MPEG-1 Layer 2\nAudio Bitrate: 224kbps 2ch CBR 44100H","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d99af46ca970f260e50103f871ffbd58c827b34","amp;dn":"Muslims+and+Non-Muslims+Relations+%28Misunderstood+Quranic+Texts%29%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d99af46ca970f260e50103f871ffbd58c827b34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,153,175,70,202,151,15,38,14,80,16,63,135,31,251,213,140,130,123,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
