The lineup playing on the The Last Laugh was Doug Rowe, Terry Wilkins, Sam See and Colin Walker. However by the end of 1974 the group had had its day. Sam See and Terry Wilkins toured and recorded with Canadian band Lighthouse. Doug Rowe remained in Toronto, where he set up his own studio and lived for some years before eventually returning to Australia. By 1982 he had returned to Australia where he formed country-rock band, Grand Junction, which went on to win a Golden Guitar at Australia&amp;#039;s annual Tamworth Country Music Festival for its very Flying Circus sounding track &quot;Married Women&quot;.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f88d78bb6d5e9a8f2774ae7bbafd1948ae10372c","amp;dn":"Flying+Circus+-+Last+Laugh%5B1974%5D+LP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f88d78bb6d5e9a8f2774ae7bbafd1948ae10372c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,141,120,187,109,94,154,143,39,116,174,123,186,253,25,72,174,16,55,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
