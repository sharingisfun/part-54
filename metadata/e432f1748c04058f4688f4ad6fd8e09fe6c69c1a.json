All the issues I could find of Ringo Kid. Both Atlas (v1) and Marvel (v2) series are included.\n\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nhe Ringo Kid debuted in the anthology Wild Western #26 (Feb. 1953). His series Ringo Kid (first three issues titled Ringo Kid Western) ran 21 issues (Aug. 1954 - Sept. 1957), with his adventures drawn primarily by Joe Maneely and Fred Kida Stories ran occasionally as well in Wild Western ÃƒÂ¢?? with artist John Severin taking the reins in at least issues #46-47 (Nov. 1955 - Jan. 1956) ÃƒÂ¢?? and Ringo was the lead feature in the two-issue anthology series Western Trails (May &amp; July 1957).\n\nMarvel reprinted the series in Ringo Kid Vol. 2, #1-30 (Jan. 1970 - Nov. 1976), often with the original Maneely covers. The Ringo Kid made his first appearance in present-day stories in a time travel tale in the superhero-team comic The Avengers #142 (Dec. 1975)\n\nMarvel writer Steve Englehart planned a revival series at about this time, with art by Dick Ayers: &quot;Every series I did took off so Marvel kept giving me more. I relaunched this classic Western ÃƒÂ¢?? always my favorite of Marvel&amp;#039;s true cowboy heroes (as opposed to the Two-Gun Kid, whom I also liked but who was more a superhero) ÃƒÂ¢?? with classic Western artist Dick Ayres [sic]. But after this first issue was drawn and scripted, Marvel decided to do more superheroes and fewer cowboys, so it was set aside before inking&quot;.\n\n\nCategory:\tComics\nSize:\t340.26 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n[1954 - 1957] Volume 1/Ringo Kid v1 04 (remix).cbr \t11.03 MB\n[1954 - 1957] Volume 1/Ringo Kid v1 09 (Remix).cbr \t16.92 MB\n[1954 - 1957] Volume 1/Ringo Kid v1 11 (Remix).cbr \t17.89 MB\n[1954 - 1957] Volume 1/Ringo Kid v1 12 (remix).cbr \t15.39 MB\n[1954 - 1957] Volume 1/Ringo Kid v1 14 (Remix).cbr \t14.76 MB\n[1954 - 1957] Volume 1/Ringo Kid v1 17.cbr \t21.31 MB\n[1970 - 1976] Volume 2/Ringo Kid v2 01.cbz \t25.52 MB\n[1970 - 1976] Volume 2/Ringo Kid v2 02 (C2C).cbz \t25.19 MB\n[1970 - 1976] Volume 2/Ringo Kid v2 03 (C2C).cbz \t24.44 MB\n[1970 - 1976] Volume 2/Ringo Kid v2 04 (C2C).cbr \t25.14 MB\n[1970 - 1976] Volume 2/Ringo Kid v2 05 (C2C).cbz \t25.33 MB\n[1970 - 1976] Volume 2/Ringo Kid v2 08 (C2C).cbr \t30.04 MB\n[1970 - 1976] Volume 2/Ringo Kid v2 18.cbr \t13.42 MB\n[1970 - 1976] Volume 2/Ringo Kid v2 24 (C2C).cbz \t15.46 MB\n[1970 - 1976] Volume 2/Ringo Kid v2 26 (C2C).cbz \t17.00 MB\n[1970 - 1976] Volume 2/Ringo Kid v2 27 (C2C).cbz \t17.15 MB\n[1970 - 1976] Volume 2/Ringo Kid v2 28 (C2C).cbz \t16.19 MB\n[1970 - 1976] Volume 2/Ringo Kid v2 30.cbz \t8.09 MB\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e432f1748c04058f4688f4ad6fd8e09fe6c69c1a","amp;dn":"RINGO+KID+-+ATLAS%2FMARVEL+WESTERN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e432f1748c04058f4688f4ad6fd8e09fe6c69c1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,50,241,116,140,4,5,143,70,136,244,173,111,216,224,159,230,198,156,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
