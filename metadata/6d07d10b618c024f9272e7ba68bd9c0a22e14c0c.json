The program does not require installation, and shows data as the label of unit, the type, the size, the space used and available, the format and more.  All this information refreshes every ten seconds, so that it turns out very useful to control units in which there are entered constants and exits of data.  It includes in addition other functions, like the possibility of hiding units, causing that they disappear of the Explorer of Windows and they only remain visible in the interface of Drive Manager.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d07d10b618c024f9272e7ba68bd9c0a22e14c0c","amp;dn":"Drive+Manager+2.13","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d07d10b618c024f9272e7ba68bd9c0a22e14c0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,7,209,11,97,140,2,79,146,114,231,186,104,189,156,10,34,225,76,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
