They help history along, giving it a push where it&amp;#039;s needed. He is a brave though not so intelligent human that was living as a pirate a few hundred years ago when he was chosen to be a Voyager. He travels by way of a gold pocket watch-like device called an Omni. When its light is flashing red, it means history is wrong. His job is to fix it. In the pilot episode, Bogg ends up in 1982 when his Omni, which is only suppose to go as far as 1970, malfunctions. He accidentally picks up 12 year-old orphan, Jeffery Jones (Meeno Peluce) and loses his guide book to history in the process. All is not lost as Jeffery is a smart kid with a good knowledge of history.\n\n2.
