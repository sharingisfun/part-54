Seismologist Samantha Hill sees an even greater threat: an ever-widening fault line that\\&amp;#039;s heading straight for the country\\&amp;#039;s two largest nuclear reactors. If a meltdown occurs, millions will die. Samantha and the American president agree only one man can help them-the scientist who predicted this terrifying natural disaster years before-Samantha\\&amp;#039;s own father, Dr. Earl Hill, now counted as a possible casualty of a massive Las Vegas quake. Together with a crack rescue team including Brad and Will, Samantha must find her father and stop the fault from slicing uncontrollably toward millions of people and the ultimate nuclear apocalypse.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1174de25287c56d2c3a1d9d3665d95d1abbbe458","amp;dn":"10.5+Apocalypse.PDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1174de25287c56d2c3a1d9d3665d95d1abbbe458","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,116,222,37,40,124,86,210,195,161,217,211,102,93,149,209,171,187,228,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
