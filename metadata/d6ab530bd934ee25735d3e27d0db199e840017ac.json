(2004)\n\nSpecial Force (2007)\n\nNitro Microphone Underground, the 8 MC&amp;#039;s of unquestionable talent are true legends of the new generation rap game. Consisting of 8 superstar MC&amp;#039;s Deli, Gore-Tex, XBS, S-Word, Dabo, Suiken, Bigzam &amp; Macka Chin, the group changed the face of hip-hop in Japan with their self titled album in the year 2000. Most oftenly compared to the legends in the bible, the album blew the whole nation of Japan off their feet and spawned 8 very succesful solo careers much like the Wu-Tang Clan phenomenon in America. The legend starts from 1997 when many of the groups members were already working together and talking about forming a group of huge potential in their home base of &amp;#039;Udagawa&amp;#039; in Shibuya, Tokyo. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cultureuniversal.com/jk/nitro.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cultureuniversal.com/jk/nitro.htm&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6ab530bd934ee25735d3e27d0db199e840017ac","amp;dn":"Nitro+Microphone+Underground+Album+Pack%21+NMU","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6ab530bd934ee25735d3e27d0db199e840017ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,171,83,11,217,52,238,37,115,93,62,39,208,219,25,158,132,0,23,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
