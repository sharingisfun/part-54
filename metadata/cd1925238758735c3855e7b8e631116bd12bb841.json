All components were\n removed with &quot;nLite&quot; v1.4.5 b2\n\n  COMPONENTS\n\n -All Languages With Non-English Characters (100Mb?)\n -Drivers - Printers, Display Adapters, Modems (53.74Mb)\n -Game Controller Images and Backgrounds (3.36Mb)\n -Music Samples (4.54Mb)\n -MSN Explorer (18.80Mb)\n -Windows Messenger (930Kb)\n -Manual Install and Upgrade (44Mb)\n -MS Agent (2.17Mb)\n -Out of Box Experience (OOBE) (5Mb)\n -Search Assistant (5.55Mb)\n -Security Center (110Kb)\n -Service Pack Messages (6Mb)\n -Tour (17.46Mb)\n -Error Reporting (140Kb)\n\n\n  DIRECTORIES\n\n -cmpnents (25.7Mb)\n -DOCS (6.73Kb)\n -DOTNETFX (39.1Mb)\n -SUPPORT (12.8Mb)\n -VALUEADD (9.16Mb)\n\n\n Removing all these items saved about 355Mb from the ISO.\n\n This might be called &quot;TinyXP&quot; but it is intended to be as\n complete as possible. Only useless or otherwise redundant\n items have been removed. Do read the list above carefully.\n For most people, you will not even notice anything is\n missing, that is the aim. Also, because Windows XP has\n been reduced in size by a considerable amount, this has\n allowed the inclusion of a massive pool of drivers for\n all your devices! The drivers on this CD take up more\n space than the OS. Its about 250Mb for the I386 folder,\n 40Mb for the $OEM$ folder (contains IE7, DirectX files,\n Flash for IE etc) and then about 360Mb of added drivers.\n\n\n ----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n DISABLED FEATURES\n -----------------\n\n Hibernate is disabled, but still usable.\n System Restore is disabled, but can be enabled.\n Indexing Service is disabled.\n Windows File Protection is disabled.\n\n\n ----------------------------------------------------------------\n \n REGISTRY TWEAKS\n ---------------\n\n There are far too many registry tweaks to mention here.
