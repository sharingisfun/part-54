Inspired by former TechTV?s The Screen Savers (1998-2005), Hak.5 started out as an underground attempt to bring back tech entertainment. Within its first few months ?on air? the show had become a hit among tech enthusiasts while mainstream media had begun to notice the booming Internet television world. Since then Hak.5 has appeared on G4TechTV?s Call for Help with Leo Laporte and Torrent with Amber MacArthur, as well as in Wired Magazine, PC Format Magazine, the Computer America Radio show, the TWiT podcast, and even Adventures of Superman. Despite this Hak.5 remains independent from a studio or channel sponsor to this day. The show is produced out of pocket from the co-hosts? home built studio, each episode pushing for ever higher quality. While the cast and crew are not formally television trained they have enormous geek ambition.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.hak5.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.hak5.org/&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0208ad0c5050bf572c3a3ff717358ff8664b96fa","amp;dn":"Hak5+Season+02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0208ad0c5050bf572c3a3ff717358ff8664b96fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,8,173,12,80,80,191,87,44,58,63,247,23,53,143,248,102,75,150,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
