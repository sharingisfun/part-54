On the one hand, there are some incredibly rare tracks here by terrifically obscure bands; on the other, only about 15 of the 24 songs here are all that interesting, or even listenable more than once. The best (and best-sounding) act here is the Gurus (who are also represented on the front cover), identified as five collegiate music majors from New York, who have a muscular yet melodic attack on their instruments. The Misty Wizards&amp;#039; &quot;It&amp;#039;s Love&quot; is spacy fun, with electric sitar noodling over ethereal singing, and the Capes of Good Hopes&amp;#039; &quot;Lady Margaret&quot; offers some catchy hooks over engaging folk-rock-style rhythm guitar and lead guitar noodling. But a lot of what&amp;#039;s here is uneven, selected based on its rarity rather than its effectiveness or attractiveness; Freeborne&amp;#039;s &quot;Land of Diana,&quot; for example, has so many shifts in tempo and fragmented melodic passages (including a shift out of psychedelic freak-out choruses and into a scat section) that it&amp;#039;s difficult to imagine it getting played anywhere. There are some real surprises here as well, like &quot;Brink of Death&quot; by Childe Harold, a New York outfit produced by Walter Carlos, complete with orchestral accompaniment, eerie sound effects, and a pleasantly dissolute mood broken by some lively hard-rocking passages -- kind of like the Rolling Stones&amp;#039; &quot;In Another Land.&quot; One number designated as a &quot;Mystery Track,&quot; cut sometime in 1968 in Boston, apparently cut for a low-budget exploitation film, does sound like a lost Jefferson Airplane number circa After Bathing At Baxters. The sound is surprisingly good throughout, and producer Erik Lindgren has provided fairly thorough notes. ~ Bruce Eder, All Music Guide\n\n\n1\t(Untitled Track)\t\t\t\t\t(:25)\t \t \n2\tIt&amp;#039;s Love\tMisty Wizards\t\t\t\t(2:09)\t \t \n3\tLady Margaret\tCapes Of Good Hopes\t\t\t(2:37)\t \t \n4\tLand of Diana\tFreeborne\t\t\t\t(2:57)\t \t \n5\tTheRake\tId\t\t\t\t\t\t(2:02)\t \t \n6\tFlowers\tTea Company\t\t\t\t\t(3:18)\t \t  \n7\tP.S.
