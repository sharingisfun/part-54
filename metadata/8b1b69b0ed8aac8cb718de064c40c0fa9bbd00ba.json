As an activist historian he is best known for his George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography (1992), a masterpiece of research which is still must reading. He is a 9/11 Truth Scholar and activist; AB Princeton 1966, summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa; Fulbright Scholar at University of Turin, Italy; and MA in humanities from Skidmore College. He is fluent in Italian, German, French, Latin and Russian. A decades-long expert on international terrorism, his 1978 study for the Italian parliament &quot;Chi ha ucciso Aldo Moro?&quot; (Who Killed Aldo Moro?) broke open the ownership of the &quot;Red Brigades&quot; by NATO&amp;#039;s clandestine &quot;stay-behind&quot; networks.
