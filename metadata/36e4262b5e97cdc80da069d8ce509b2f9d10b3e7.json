However, this solution is not quite secure, moreover, it is dangerous.\nIn case your notebook is lost or the file is copied, your personal information \nwill be in someone else&amp;#039;s hands.\n\nFlyingBit Password Keeper offers a simple solution for all these problems.\nData is stored in a special encrypted database. \nThus, even if someone gains access to the storage, it will be impossible to\nread information from it. \nDue to reliable encryption algorithms, such as AES, Towfish and Blowfish, \nyour password database is securely protected. \nTo read the storage, you need the password that only you know.\nOn the whole, it is easier to memorize one password than a dozen passwords.\n\nFlyingBit Password Keeper allows you to create your database on a removable\nmedia with one click. \nIt occupies minimum space and can work without installation.\nDue to this, all the necessary information is always at hand even if you work \nwith another computer.\n\nMain features:\n\n* Supporting various database encryption algorithms\n* Grouping entries by categories\n* Automatically clearing the clipboard\n* Copying the value of a field with one mouse click\n* Supporting custom fields\n* Storing notes\n* Simple and clear interface\n* Comfortable navigation with the help of a tree-like list\n* Working with removable media\n* Supporting operating systems from Windows 98 to Vista\n\nHomepage: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.flyingbit.com/products/password_keeper/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.flyingbit.com/products/password_keeper/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHandy App.\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36e4262b5e97cdc80da069d8ce509b2f9d10b3e7","amp;dn":"+FlyingBit+-+Password+Keeper","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36e4262b5e97cdc80da069d8ce509b2f9d10b3e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,228,38,43,94,151,205,200,13,160,105,216,206,80,155,47,157,16,179,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
