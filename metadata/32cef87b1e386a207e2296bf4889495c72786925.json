The film is set mostly in the apartment of the homosexual, who hasn&amp;#039;t had sex in a long while. Although the two are reluctant to reveal much about themselves, they gradually begin to confide in one another. Among the topics they discuss are relationships, loneliness, feminism, their sexual identities and even Emily Dickinson. As the night wears on, however, the bisexual becomes afraid that the man he has just slept with could have infected him with AIDS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32cef87b1e386a207e2296bf4889495c72786925","amp;dn":"Together+Alone","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32cef87b1e386a207e2296bf4889495c72786925","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,206,248,123,30,56,106,32,126,34,150,191,72,137,73,92,114,120,105,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
