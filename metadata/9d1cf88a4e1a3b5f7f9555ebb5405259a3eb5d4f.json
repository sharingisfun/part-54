Farewell By Chip Monck Source: 1 CD Hendrix Woodstock\n\n-------\nDISC TWENTY: THE BONUS DISC\n-------\nIn 2004 when I edited the original \\&quot;Complete\\&quot; set there was a list of stray tunes visible at the bottom of my original track list. Those stray tunes were originally supposed to wind up on a \\&quot;bonus disc\\&quot; of goodies. That disc was never compiled for that set, but I have fixed that. Here it is finally!\n\nTHE FREE STAGE\nAlongside the other gems on the legendary \\&quot;audience tape\\&quot; made at the festival (I guess I should say \\&quot;First audience tape\\&quot; now that other audience-recorded materials have surfaced) are three tunes recorded at the so-called \\&quot;free stage\\&quot;. On this stage a number of different people performed, and it was indeed \\&quot;free\\&quot; in the sense that anyone could come up and play for the small gathering around it. Tom Law did some yoga classes there, and we do know that both Quill and Joan Baez entertained people there. I cannot identify the artists who performed these tunes with any certainty, although the \\&quot;Eleanor Rigby\\&quot; has been attributed to Joan Baez (it does sound a bit like her). Judging by their placement on the tape, these segments were recorded Friday night, seemingly during the rainstorm that evening.\n\n1. Walking To The Free Stage (NOTE: Maybe they are, and maybe they aren\\&amp;#039;t. I\\&amp;#039;d like to think that they were)\n2. Eleanor Rigby\n3. I\\&amp;#039;m Your Dream\n\nUNUSED AUDIENCE TAPE SEGMENTS\nGiven the fact that most of the audience tape material has appeared in superior quality from SBD sources, it is pretty obvious that most of the \\&quot;First audience tape\\&quot; wasn\\&amp;#039;t usable for this project. But the material is really interesting, and deserved it\\&amp;#039;s own place, so here it is.\n\n4. Richie Havens - With A Little Help From My Friends\n5. Country Joe McDonald - I Feel Like I\\&amp;#039;m Fixin\\&amp;#039; To Die Rag\n6. Santana - Waiting\n7. Santana - You Just Don\\&amp;#039;t Care\n8. Santana - Savor\n9. Santana - Soul Sacrifice\n10. John Sebastian - Stage chat\n11. Janis Joplin - Raise Your Hand\n12. The Who - Heaven And Hell\n13. The Who - Naked Eye (end)\n\nOTHER UNUSED AUDIO SEGMENTS\nSome interesting items from the Wadleigh film outtakes.\n\n14. I Wish I Could Be The Rain (Jerry Garcia and Rosalie Sorrels, in the field behind the main stage, early Friday evening)\n15. A Ride To Michigan (Furthur Bus, Saturday afternoon)\n16. The Red Shoes (Furthur Bus, Saturday afternoon)\n\nTHE GREAT DECEPTIONS\nFor some reason Arlo Guthrie and the members of Mountain were not happy with their performance at Woodstock, and several items from their sets that were officially released were either not recorded at Woodstock or altered considerably. For the sake of completeness, here are the offenders. There may be more.\n\n17. Arlo Guthrie - Coming Into Los Angeles (From the Soundtrack LP - not the version recorded at Woodstock)\n18. Mountain - Blood Of The Sun (from the Woodstock Two LP - again, this was not recorded at Woodstock)\n19. Mountain - Theme From An Imaginary Western (Woodstock Two LP - ditto. The correct version is in this set)\n20. Mountain - Southbound Train (from Woodstock Diary CD. This version uses the backing tracks from the festival with a re-recorded (in 1970) Leslie West vocal. I shudder to think that they erased the lead vocal from the multitrack, but it would seem so)\n21. Crosby Stills Nash &amp; Young - Sea Of Madness (though the intro as it appears on the Soundtrack LP is from the festival, the actual song is taken from a show recorded at the Fillmore East in New York on September 20, 1969.\n\nTHE COMPLETE \\&quot;BLACKSTEAD TAPES\\&quot; EXCERPTS\nIn 2001, the estate of Eric Blackstead, the late producer of both the Soundtrack and Woodstock Two LPs, auctioned off a number of tapes recorded at Woodstock. To promote this on a specially-created website, several MP3 excerpts were made available. Although I have used very few of them in the set itself, they are worth having, so here is the full set. This is the only multitrack source available for several cuts.\n\n22. Jimi Hendrix - Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\n23. Jimi Hendrix - Stage chat\n24. Jimi Hendrix - Getting My Heart Back Together Again\n25. Crosby Stills &amp; Nash - Blackbird\n26. The Band - Chest Fever\n27. Creedence Clearwater Revival - Born On The Bayou\n28. Country Joe McDonald - I Feel Like I\\&amp;#039;m Fixin\\&amp;#039; To Die Rag\n29. Sha Na Na - Wipe Out\n30. Joe Cocker - Let\\&amp;#039;s Go Get Stoned\n31. The Who - My Generation\n32. Janis Joplin - Work Me Lord\n33. Janis Joplin - Summertime\n\n\n\n\nAND FINALLY (a little list of performances debunked):\n\nperformances listed on other websites and setlists that were in fact NOT recorded at Woodstock, and other stuff:\n\nRichie Havens\n-I Had A Woman\nFrom color film outtake. Actually just a part of \\&quot;High Flyin\\&amp;#039; Bird\\&quot;.\n\nJoan Baez\n-Eleanor Rigby (2:28)\nFrom the Redmond/Campbell tape. Recorded on August 17, 1969 on the free stage at the Festival. Not from her main stage performance, Unfortunately!! Still great as it\\&amp;#039;s the only recording we have of anyone from the free stage (Quill reportedly performed there as well).\n\nCanned Heat\n-Let\\&amp;#039;s Work Together\n-Too Many Drivers At The Wheel\nFrom \\&quot;Woodstock Nation\\&quot; bootleg LP. Unfortunately not recorded at Woodstock, but at another unknown festival.\n\nCountry Joe And The Fish\n-Barry\\&amp;#039;s Caviar Dream\nFrom \\&quot;Woodstock Nation\\&quot; bootleg LP. Unfortunately not recorded at Woodstock, but at another unknown festival.\n\nBlood Sweat And Tears\n-I Stand Accused\nFrom color film outtake. Actually just a part of \\&quot;More And More\\&quot;.\n\nPaul Butterfield Blues Band\n-Born Under A Bad Sign\nFrom \\&quot;Woodstock Nation\\&quot; bootleg LP. Unfortunately not recorded at Woodstock, but at another unknown festival.\n\nSha-Na-Na\n-Na Na Theme\n-Yakety Yak\n-Teen Angel\n-Jailhouse Rock\nFrom \\&quot;Woodstock Nation\\&quot; bootleg LP. Unfortunately not recorded at Woodstock. It would appear that this a much later lineup of Sha Na Na, recorded at one of their concerts in the 1970s at the height of their popularity. The back cover of \\&quot;Woodstock Nation\\&quot; alludes to a more complete bootleg of this concert being issued by the Altasta Record Co. but I have no idea if it was ever issued!!\n\n\n\nSeed &amp; Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d1cf88a4e1a3b5f7f9555ebb5405259a3eb5d4f","amp;dn":"Woodstock+Complete+Version+3+Discs+13-20+%2B+bonus+artwork","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d1cf88a4e1a3b5f7f9555ebb5405259a3eb5d4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,28,248,138,78,26,59,95,127,149,85,235,181,64,82,89,163,235,93,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
