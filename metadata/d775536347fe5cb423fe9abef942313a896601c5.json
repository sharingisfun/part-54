With its \nsteamy vocal and genuine, if uncharacteristic, touches of wit throbbing above Deep Purple&amp;#039;s heavy signature sound, &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; \nsets the tone for this venerable band&amp;#039;s reunion album. Lead singer Ian Gillan ? who&amp;#039;s never been in finer, and deeper, throat ? \nsinuously glides into lyrics that suggest these veterans have something to say about where they&amp;#039;ve been in the last few years (&quot;Can you \nremember, remember my name ... I am the echo of your past&quot;) and have lots more to offer in the future. For a moment, you almost \nwonder why Purple ever faded away in the first place. Until, that is, you hear the rest of the album.\nExcepting the title cut and the rambunctious but less effective &quot;Knocking at Your Back Door,&quot; the material consists of hastily knocked-off \njams that allow guitar demigod Ritchie Blackmore to whip out his finger exercises in public. The band spent about six to eight weeks \nrecording this comeback. (The current lineup is actually neither the original nor the final Deep Purple but the most successful ? of \n&quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; fame.) It doesn&amp;#039;t sound as if they spent much more time thinking about it, either.\nBlackmore&amp;#039;s Strat has such a great roar that you&amp;#039;re willing to just let it reverberate in your eardrums for a bit. And it&amp;#039;s nice to hear Jon \nLord&amp;#039;s unsynthesized organ squalls, Ian Paice&amp;#039;s meaty pounding, Gillan&amp;#039;s howls and whispers and Roger Glover&amp;#039;s solid bass lines once \nagain. Eventually, though, it&amp;#039;s &quot;enough of the sound check already ? where are the songs?&quot; Instead of Glover, an outside producer \nmight have forced the band to tighten up its licks and arrangements. Then again, did Deep Purple ever have more than one or two \nreally good, concise numbers on an album? Maybe they&amp;#039;re just making the kind of record they always did, the only kind they know how \nto make.\nSo why are they doing this? To cash in on the current heavy-metal craze, in which dozens of young upstarts are making fortunes \nplaying Purple riffs? Following a recent meet-the-press shebang promoting the album and impending world tour, the band members \n(minus the temperamental Blackmore, who, true to his &quot;enigmage,&quot; didn&amp;#039;t show) insisted they don&amp;#039;t need the dough. Perhaps the \nanswer lies in &quot;Wasted Sunsets,&quot; a portrait of an aging rock star who&amp;#039;s got &quot;gold and silver for the blues&quot; but nothing to do except drink \nthe nights away. It&amp;#039;s nice that Perfect Strangers got the Purples out of their respective mansions; too bad they didn&amp;#039;t venture farther \nfrom home.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\nATTENTION, Please\n\n\nIf you have already downloaded the previous torrent of this same release, don&amp;#039;t trash the files you&amp;#039;ve already downloaded.\nPut them inside the folder of this new torrent so you can resume downloading from 99.8%\n\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d775536347fe5cb423fe9abef942313a896601c5","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Perfect+Strangers+%281984%29+%28%5C%2799+Rem.%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d775536347fe5cb423fe9abef942313a896601c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,117,83,99,71,254,92,180,35,254,154,190,249,66,49,58,137,102,1,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
