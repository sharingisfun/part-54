Spy Fiction is heavy with spy gadgets and weapons and supposedly introduces new elements to stealth; including an optical camouflage suit and the ability to disguise yourself as any character in the game. In a unique twist, players can control the completely interactive cutscenes using the in-game engine, and follow the various mission briefings to make the next areas more or less difficult.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:899c2180b5010bc7711aa9db3bcbec0b60b8f7b5","amp;dn":"Spy+Fiction+PS2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"899c2180b5010bc7711aa9db3bcbec0b60b8f7b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,156,33,128,181,1,11,199,113,26,169,219,59,203,236,11,96,184,247,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
