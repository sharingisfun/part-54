Some alt-country artists have been influenced by Bob Dylan, and the \nlate Johnny Cash is idolized on the folk circuit. On top of that, it is no secret \nthat American folk, country, and bluegrass all owe a debt of gratitude to the \ntraditional Irish, Scottish, and British songs that immigrants brought to the \nUnited States many years ago. So considering everything that folk and \ncountry have in common, it isn't surprising when one comes across a CD that \nhas one foot in folk-rock and the other in country-rock -- a CD like Angel \nBand's second album, With Roots &amp; Wings. Because Angel Band are an \nall-female vocal trio that contributes to country-rock, some listeners may be \ntempted to compare them to the Dixie Chicks or SHeDAISY -- and it should be \nnoted that Lloyd Maines (father of the Dixie Chicks' lead singer, Natalie \nMaines) does most of the producing on this 2008 release. But Angel Band \naren't nearly as slick or glossy as the Dixie Chicks or SHeDAISY can be; With \nRoots &amp; Wings is a lot more organic-sounding, and it has more to offer from a \nfolk-rock standpoint. It is hard to imagine corporate country stations \nembracing rootsy gems like &quot;Drown in the Fountain of Good,&quot; &quot;Moon Over \nMontgomery,&quot; and &quot;Do Not Stand at My Grave and Weep,&quot; but it is easy to \nenvision this excellent CD receiving a favorable response from both folk and \nalternative country audiences. Nancy Josephson, Jen Schonwald, and \nKathleen Weber (collectively Angel Band) are fine singers who handle \nthemselves impressively well on original material as well as a cover of Chip \nTaylor's &quot;Angel of the Morning.&quot; With Roots &amp; Wings is a consistently \nrewarding sophomore effort from Angel Band. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71750e5d12bd26fcdaac6c07e5ab807fe31fc9e8","amp;dn":"Angel+Band+-+With+Roots+%26+Wings+%5B2008%2FVBR176%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71750e5d12bd26fcdaac6c07e5ab807fe31fc9e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,117,14,93,18,189,38,252,218,172,108,7,229,171,128,127,227,31,201,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
