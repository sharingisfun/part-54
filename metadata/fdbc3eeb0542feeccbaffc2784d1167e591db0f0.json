The setting is the planet Lythion in the year 40,000, when Barbarella (Jane Fonda) makes a forced landing while travelling through space. She acts like a female James Bond, vanquishing evil in the forms of robots and monsters. She also rewards, in an uninhibited manner, the handsome men who assist her in the adventure. Wheather she is wrestlingen with Black Guards, the evil Queen, or the Angel Pygar, she just can't seem to avoid losing at least part of her sin-tight space suit.\n\n+ svenska o engelska subtitles rippade frÃƒÂ¥n dvd:n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdbc3eeb0542feeccbaffc2784d1167e591db0f0","amp;dn":"Barbarella+%28Jane+Fonda+1968%29+-+DVDRip+Xvid","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdbc3eeb0542feeccbaffc2784d1167e591db0f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,188,62,235,5,66,254,236,203,175,252,39,132,209,22,126,89,29,176,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
