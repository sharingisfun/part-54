I decided to release it independently after the multiple news stories came out about food shortages suspected.  While they may be just stories, I thought maybe this info could help people prepare incase those news stories turn out to be right.\n\nThis is my first attempt at this procedure, and I encourage you to do your own research.  Any feedback on the video or it&amp;#039;s subject matter would be appreciated.\n\nWould like to thank RantMedia for all that it does and for inspiring myself and others like me to produce our own content and get it out on the wires.  Much props to SKTFM, Cimmerian, Enloopious and UrbanKraft.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dcecac34a26953af4646c2d2a29bff1b92bf4730","amp;dn":"UrbanKraft+%3A+Food+Preperation+-+Long+Term+Storage+of+Rice+by+Buc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dcecac34a26953af4646c2d2a29bff1b92bf4730","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,236,172,52,162,105,83,175,70,70,194,210,162,155,255,27,146,191,71,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
