Adam, Jamie and Brandon will test with some of the students whether electric cars are more sluggish than cars that are driven with gasoline. I?ve never actually heard that myth so I?ll be excited to see how this one works. Then to get to the stinky side of it all Alyssa and Catherine get to test to see if methane gas from cows are really bad for the planet or if it can be used as an alternative fuel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4398c063e0c36b1331d10cb787b1c25e27757643","amp;dn":"Mythbusters+s6.Young.Scientist.Special.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4398c063e0c36b1331d10cb787b1c25e27757643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,152,192,99,224,195,107,19,49,209,12,183,135,177,194,94,39,117,118,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
