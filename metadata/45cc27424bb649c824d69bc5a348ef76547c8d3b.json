This is done just to avoid having the sloppy DOS window in the background. Some AVs complain with it recognizing RunHiddenConsole.exe as a malicious/potentially harmful program as it can be used to hide malicious behaviours. If it&amp;#039;s your case, or just don&amp;#039;t trust in the first one, just use the second version.\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45cc27424bb649c824d69bc5a348ef76547c8d3b","amp;dn":"Perfect+Uninstaller+v5.5+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45cc27424bb649c824d69bc5a348ef76547c8d3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,204,39,66,75,182,73,200,36,214,155,197,163,72,239,118,84,124,141,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
