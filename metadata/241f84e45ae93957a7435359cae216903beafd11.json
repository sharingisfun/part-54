The musical style owes something to the shoegazing genre in its extensive use of reverb effects and lyrics spoken softly over loud instrumentals, though M83&amp;#039;s songs employ considerably less guitar than most shoegazing bands such as My Bloody Valentine.\n\nSaturdays = Youth, M83&amp;#039;s fifth studio album was released on April 15, 2008 on Mute Records. It was recorded with Ken Thomas (known for his work with Sigur RÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³s, The Sugarcubes, Boys in a Band, Cocteau Twins and Suede), Ewan Pearson (who has also produced for Tracey Thorn, The Rapture and Ladytron) and Morgan Kibby (of The Romanovs, and Morgan and the Hidden Hands). The album is said to deliver the rich sonic textures for which M83 is well known, but with a more focused approach to song structure and form. &quot;Couleurs&quot; is the first single from the new album, released to digital retailers on February 25, 2008. The album&amp;#039;s second single, &quot;Graveyard Girl,&quot; was released to digital retailers on April 8, 2008 and comes with an exclusive remix from Yuksek.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:241f84e45ae93957a7435359cae216903beafd11","amp;dn":"M83+-+Graveyard+Girl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"241f84e45ae93957a7435359cae216903beafd11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,31,132,228,90,233,57,87,167,67,83,89,202,226,22,144,59,234,253,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
