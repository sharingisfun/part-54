About a up and coming basketball player that must resist the temptation of dirty money, easy women and violence. The basketball scenes in this are pretty fantastic for the pure basketball fans. I mean a real basketball player can tell when someone is playing or pretending to play and this movie did a pretty good job on that element. It also showcases Tupac's acting abilities with his various confrontations with his characters estranged older brother. An overall good movie to watch.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc67474f43869e89fa20b9ba13ccff325a2bdc8b","amp;dn":"Above+the+Rim+%282pac%29%28Pollack%2C+1994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc67474f43869e89fa20b9ba13ccff325a2bdc8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,103,71,79,67,134,158,137,250,32,185,186,19,204,255,50,90,43,220,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
