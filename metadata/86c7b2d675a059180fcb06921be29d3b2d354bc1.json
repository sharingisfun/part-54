She reportedly began singing as soon as she could talk and began writing song lyrics in notebooks when she was only five or six years old. Shepherd entered her first country showdown when she was eight, singing Patsy Cline songs, and was soon performing regularly at local fairs, benefits, and community events. She picked up the guitar when she was 15 and that same year her parents helped finance a self-released CD, which Shepherd sold at her shows. In 2006 she won a talent contest in Gilbertown, AL, for which the prize was an opening slot at a Lorrie Morgan concert. Spotted by a Nashville producer at the Morgan show, Shepherd was invited to Nashville to record, and soon signed with MCA Nashville, beginning work on an album, Sounds So Good, with veteran producer Buddy Cannon later that same year. A debut single from the project, the impressive &quot;Takin&amp;#039; Off This Pain,&quot; hit the airwaves in September of 2007. \n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nARTIST: Ashton Shepherd\nTITLE: Sounds So Good\nLABEL: MCA Nashville/Universal\nGENRE: Country\nGRABBER: EAC (Secure Mode)\nENCODER: Lame 3.97 / -V2 --vbr-new\nQUALITY: 194 Kbps Avg / 44.1 KHz / Joint Stereo\nPLAYTIME: 0h 40min 44sec total\nSIZE: 56.51MB\nRELEASE DATE: 2008-03-04\nRIP DATE: 2008-02-20\n\n\nTrack List\n----------\n01.

When I picked up the guitar, the\nsongs just started pouring out, just one after the other.&quot; &quot;This is what I was\nborn to do,&quot; says Ashton in her honey-smooth, deep-Alabama accent. &quot;I&amp;#039;ve always\nbeen singing, but it didn&amp;#039;t come from me. I didn&amp;#039;t just teach myself to sing.\nI&amp;#039;ve always sung. The songwriting is the same. As soon as I was big enough to\nwrite on paper, I was coming up with stuff. I&amp;#039;ve got notebooks where I was\nwriting down songs when I couldn&amp;#039;t even spell correctly, from the time I was\nfive, six, seven years old.&quot;\n\n&quot;I can&amp;#039;t wait to meet people and for people to meet me. I hope everybody\nconnects with my music as well as Nashville has. I think they will. I think\npeople will feel the realness in my songs. I&amp;#039;ve always dreamed of this ride I&amp;#039;m\nabout to take. I feel as blessed as I&amp;#039;ve ever felt in my life.&quot;\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to support the artists! We did.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86c7b2d675a059180fcb06921be29d3b2d354bc1","amp;dn":"Ashton+Shepherd-Sounds+So+Good+%282008-VBR-Advance%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86c7b2d675a059180fcb06921be29d3b2d354bc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,199,178,214,117,160,89,24,15,203,6,146,27,226,157,59,45,53,75,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
