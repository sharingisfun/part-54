The song was the third track on the album and was the fourth track from the album to become a single, which reached #4 in the US and #14 in the UK in 1987. The music was written by the band, while the lyrics were written by guitarist Mike Rutherford. \n\nThe song is remembered by many Genesis fans because of its video, which featured puppets from the 1980s UK sketch show, Spitting Image. The song was played on their Invisible Touch, We Can&amp;#039;t Dance, and Turn It On Again: The Tour tours, though always transposed down a key to account for the deepening of Phil Collins&amp;#039;s voice over the years.\n\nThe song is widely remembered for its music video, which had heavy airplay on MTV. The video drew controversy for its portrayal of Ronald Reagan as being physically and cognitively inept. The video features puppets by the British television show Spitting Image. After Phil Collins saw a disfigured version of himself on the show, he commissioned the shows creators, Peter Fluck and Roger Law, to create puppets of the entire band, as well as all the characters in the video.\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc070fde4febd4d43c7ea16388429d354ef5bd91","amp;dn":"Genesis+-+Land+Of+Confusion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc070fde4febd4d43c7ea16388429d354ef5bd91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,7,15,222,79,235,212,212,60,126,161,99,136,66,157,53,78,245,189,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
