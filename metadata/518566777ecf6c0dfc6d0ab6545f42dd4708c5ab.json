I just reformatted my computer the other day, and have not since downloaded anything with one.\n\n~Kaleidosk\n\nP.S.\nI'm a bit late addressing this (try two fucking years), but:\nWhen I created this torrent, I had little knowledge of proper mounting and whatnot, so I assumed everybody else just extracted .ISO files with WinRAR like I did, and installed from there.\n\nAlso, to the tools who keep saying &quot;FUK U IT NO WERK&quot;, it works. You're just too thick-skulled to figure it out.\nI'll go ahead and recreate a more Daemon Tools-friendly torrent soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:518566777ecf6c0dfc6d0ab6545f42dd4708c5ab","amp;dn":"Oblivion+GOTY+%2B+OfficialPlugins","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"518566777ecf6c0dfc6d0ab6545f42dd4708c5ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,133,102,119,126,207,108,13,252,109,10,182,84,95,66,221,71,8,197,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
