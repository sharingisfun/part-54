The band hails from Cincinnati and plays a kind of music thatÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½s fairly different from what Ive ever heard on Victory. BTS is said to be compared to the likes of Carcass, Hypocrisy, Shadows Fall and Killswitch Engage\nand with What Demons Do To Saints they ve released their debut full-length.  \n \nIn my opinion the extreme death part of the music is predominantly created by vocalist Joey Nelson his screams are really nasty and remind me a bit of those of The Agony Scenes Mike Williams. And although both vocalists handle this nasty screaming almost constantly throughout the album, theres also some space left for melodic (backing) vocals. Personally I do not consider that to be a bad thing but I do have to say that the melodic parts on this album are quite the opposite of the screams. So for that aspect...\n\nAll in all Beneath The Sky has unleashed a great debut album upon the world,\nwhich convinced me to go see them live one day.\n\nhave Fun hearing...\n\nReactions are Welcome!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ace9de2caee7ed01980f662679f6688ca874d31e","amp;dn":"Beneath+The+Sky+-+What+Demons+Do+To+Saints+%5BMetalcore%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ace9de2caee7ed01980f662679f6688ca874d31e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,233,222,44,174,231,237,1,152,15,102,38,121,246,104,140,168,116,211,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
