The EMI record is Copy controlled, which is evidently bad for playback on many kinds of devices. With my equipment, ripping failed or produced the famous polluted rips that are the product of the copy protection. There is no reason for ripping and publishing this material, except the fact that EMI chose to rip off its customers by packaging the media as a CD, while the disc itself is not conformant to the Red Book.\n\nNote that you should be able to return a purchased disc to the shop with a full refound.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48a6c9fbdeb103ceab26ddbe4fd9d60294adfbb6","amp;dn":"Eloy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48a6c9fbdeb103ceab26ddbe4fd9d60294adfbb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,166,201,251,222,177,3,206,171,38,221,190,79,217,214,2,148,173,251,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
