Grover Washington, Jr.)\nMP3/256kbps\n\nLarry Coryell sings through this set in his most romantic voice: The opening, title track features smooth soulman Peabo Bryson singing in tandem with Sharon Bryant and Grover Washington Jr.&amp;#039;s sweet soprano, and with just Washington in Tonight is the Night. Try a Little Tenderness lights the candlelight mood for Coryell and Chuck Loeb to dance on flamenco guitars, cushioned by soft keyboard whispers, of a piece with Coryell&amp;#039;s instrumental slow dance with The Isley Brothers&amp;#039; &quot;quiet storm&quot; classic For the Love of You. The guitarist sharpens his blues hooks on W.C. Handy&amp;#039;s trademark St. Louis Blues, stabbing chords to counterpoint Harrison&amp;#039;s blues vocal and Dan Haymann&amp;#039;s piano boogie. Redwing features Coryell on both flamenco and electric guitars, as do the trios Before Dawn and Cumulus, mists of flamenco, Mark Sherman&amp;#039;s vibes and keyboards, and Zach Danziger&amp;#039;s floating drums. The concluding duet between Coryell and Loeb on Charles Mingus&amp;#039; Better Get Hit in Your Soul spins together an encyclopedic holy grail of modern guitar accompaniment and improvisation, convening a joyously blue exclamation from their guitarist&amp;#039;s souls to close.\n\nPersonnel:\nLarry Coryell - Guitar\nPeabo Bryson - Vocals\nSharon Bryant, Carmen Cuesta -Vocals (Background)\nTracy Wormworth -Bass\nChuck Loeb - Synthesizer, Keyboards\nZach Danziger - Drums\nDonald Harrison - Sax (Soprano), Sax (Tenor), Vocals\nGrover Washington, Jr. - Sax (Soprano), Sax (Tenor)\n\nTrack Listings:\n1.
