He is fascinated by ancient philosophers whose grandiose ambitions included looking for an Elixir of Life. After the death of his mother, his first unhappy experience, he goes off to University where he applies his new-found knowledge of science to manufacture a human being of enormous size and strength.\n\nWhen his creation comes to life, Frankenstein is so horrified by his own bizarre accomplishment that he falls into a delirious illness which last months.
