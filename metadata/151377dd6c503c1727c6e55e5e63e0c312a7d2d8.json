If you are new to this site or haven&amp;#039;t really participated, register for the boards so you can vote in polls on the SOTM downloads.\n\nThis show comes from the 1994 tour, probably my all time favorite tour the band has ever done. During this tour, the band was recording a lot of shows for what would become their 200 More Miles CD, their first official live CD release. If you don&amp;#039;t have this in your collection yet, run, don&amp;#039;t walk, to your local CD store and get it. The performances are fantastic, and Margo&amp;#039;s pigeon story from the Boulder Theater is hysterical.\n\nI&amp;#039;ve got several recordings from this tour, and there isn&amp;#039;t a clunker show in the lot. The band was really on fire for the whole year. The Guthrie show has always been one of my favorites, because it includes many of my favorite songs and stellar performances. Getting a &quot;Ring&quot; opener always puts a smile on my face, but the rest of the show is just as good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:151377dd6c503c1727c6e55e5e63e0c312a7d2d8","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies+1994-03-27+%40+Guthrie+Theater+-+Minneapolis%2C+MN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"151377dd6c503c1727c6e55e5e63e0c312a7d2d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,19,119,221,108,80,60,23,39,198,229,94,94,99,224,195,18,167,210,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
