Number 1 on mp3.com's\n     ÃƒÂº  power metal chart for over 2 years beating major\n     ÃƒÂº  band like Blind Guaridan. As an unsigned band, they\n     ÃƒÂº  already toured with Halford, Stratovarius, and\n     ÃƒÂº  finally signed a deal with Sanctuary early this year\n     ÃƒÂº  (Iron Maiden, Helloween). Now they are back with\n     ÃƒÂº  their long awaited debut album to take on the metal\n     ÃƒÂº  world beyond the net!!!\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº  This is the best power metal debut for a long time,\n     ÃƒÂº  or maybe even the best PM album of 2003. The guitars\n     ÃƒÂº  are absolutely insane, as well as really good songs\n     ÃƒÂº  through out the CD with a great singer!\n     ÃƒÂº  They call themselves 'Catchty Speed Power Metal' you\n     ÃƒÂº  will know why after a listen, break neck speed not\n     ÃƒÂº  for pussies! ;)\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº  There are rumours flying around, the CDs in the\n     ÃƒÂº  shops will contain many hidden music video not on\n     ÃƒÂº  this promo, so this is the one to buy after your\n     ÃƒÂº  x-mas holidays!\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº  More info on the band including DiVX videos to\n     ÃƒÂº  download at: http://www.dragonforce.com\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº  ----------------------------------------------------\n     ÃƒÂº  NOTE TO NEWBIES/NEW FANS\n     ÃƒÂº  ----------------------------------------------------\n     ÃƒÂº  A lot of people might be getting confused with this\n     ÃƒÂº  release! Five of the songs here were released on\n     ÃƒÂº  their demo 2 years ago under the band name\n     ÃƒÂº  DragonHeart which are still available on mp3.com to\n     ÃƒÂº  download.\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº  All the 5 songs of the demo have been re-recorded\n     ÃƒÂº  and sound even better.\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº  All rips here are from the album promo, not the\n     ÃƒÂº  demo. We labeled the songs in such details to avoid\n     ÃƒÂº  the confusion for you newbies when searching on the\n     ÃƒÂº  net for them. Be sure to download their demo from\n     ÃƒÂº  mp3.com as well to see the huge differences between\n     ÃƒÂº  the 2.\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº  P.S. There is a shit band call DragonHeart still\n     ÃƒÂº  around from Brazil, they are not the same band so\n     ÃƒÂº  don't get confused with their albums and\n     ÃƒÂº  DragonForce's :)\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº  ----------------------------------------------------\n     ÃƒÂº  OFFICIAL PROMO BIOGRAPHY\n     ÃƒÂº  ----------------------------------------------------\n     ÃƒÂº  Well-know in the underground for years, it is now\n     ÃƒÂº  time for Dragonforce to finally deliver their first\n     ÃƒÂº  full-length release due out in stores on January\n     ÃƒÂº  20th, 2003.  The album is being released on the\n     ÃƒÂº  'Noise Records' label.\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº  DragonForce is somewhat of a rarity, based in London\n     ÃƒÂº  England, they play a brand of music that is almost\n     ÃƒÂº  non-existent in their location. Formed in September\n     ÃƒÂº  1999, formerly known as DragonHeart, the band\n     ÃƒÂº  changed their name in December 2001 to DragonForce\n     ÃƒÂº  to avoid confusion with other bands, record labels\n     ÃƒÂº  and movies under the same name.\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº  The band is powered by the twin guitar assaults of\n     ÃƒÂº  Herman Li and Sam Totman, with singer ZP Theart,\n     ÃƒÂº  drummer Didier Almouzni, and keyboard player Vadim\n     ÃƒÂº  Pruzhanov. An ordinary line up it may seem at first,\n     ÃƒÂº  but DragonForce is uniquely backed by a diverse,\n     ÃƒÂº  multi-culture international line up (Hong Kong,\n     ÃƒÂº  England, South Africa, France, Ukraine) never seen\n     ÃƒÂº  before from a young new band.\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº  In short, DragonForce's sound can be best described\n     ÃƒÂº  as a mix of modern melodic power metal with the fury\n     ÃƒÂº  of speed metal, but the band's influence comes from\n     ÃƒÂº  wide across the metal spectrum. Catchy melodies that\n     ÃƒÂº  stick straight into your head, combined with\n     ÃƒÂº  outrageous speed, power and totally over the top\n     ÃƒÂº  dual guitar wizardry are just some of their\n     ÃƒÂº  qualities which separate them from the masses. Most\n     ÃƒÂº  importantly underneath this sonic fury lies the\n     ÃƒÂº  band's indisputable strength, their song writing.\n     ÃƒÂº  Take any of their songs and you will find enough\n     ÃƒÂº  hooks to fill an ocean, enough technical process to\n     ÃƒÂº  satisfy progressive metal lovers, guitar solos to\n     ÃƒÂº  have you playing air guitar combined with catchy\n     ÃƒÂº  melodies and the strong voice of an outstanding\n     ÃƒÂº  metal shouter.\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº  Well known in the underground, DragonForce has\n     ÃƒÂº  already toured with Halford, Stratovarius, Virgin\n     ÃƒÂº  Steele and successfully headlined their own show\n     ÃƒÂº  across England without an album out then. Previously\n     ÃƒÂº  known simply by the word of mouth among metal fans,\n     ÃƒÂº  and their songs on mp3 through the internet, the\n     ÃƒÂº  band is now more than ready to take on the world\n     ÃƒÂº  with their long awaited debut album 'Valley of the\n     ÃƒÂº  Damned'.\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº  'Valley of the Damned' was recorded in 3 different\n     ÃƒÂº  locations between May and October 2002. The drums\n     ÃƒÂº  were recorded at Jailhouse Studio in Denmark with\n     ÃƒÂº  producer Tommy Hansen (Helloween), further\n     ÃƒÂº  recordings took place at Thin Ice Studios with\n     ÃƒÂº  producer/guitarist Karl Groom (Threshold) and at\n     ÃƒÂº  band guitarist Herman Li's home studio.  The album\n     ÃƒÂº  truly shows the band's talent from performance, song\n     ÃƒÂº  writing, all the way to production!\n\n     ÃƒÅ¡Ã‚Â¿\n    ÃƒÅ¡Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â³\nÃƒÂºÃƒÂ¹ Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ‚¬Ã‚Â³Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž  ÃƒÂ¹    ÃƒÂº\n     Ã‚Â³Ã‚Â³\n  ÃƒÂºÃƒÂ¹Ãƒâ€ž|Ãƒâ„¢ A.M.R.C  N.E.W.S\n     ÃƒÂ¹\n     ÃƒÂº The 19th of May symbolized a special time for us here in\n     ÃƒÂº AMRC, it was time to take a look back at when AMRC was\n     ÃƒÂº born three years ago.  We've come a long way since then,\n     ÃƒÂº and would thank all the people who have supported, and\n     ÃƒÂº helped us in our endeavors for the past three years.\n     ÃƒÂº Big greets go out to all of our friends in the scene,\n     ÃƒÂº siteops who have been loyal to us, fans of metal music\n     ÃƒÂº worldwide, ANY metal bands reading this nfo, and other\n     ÃƒÂº metal crews in the mp3 scene.\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº We hope you enjoy our releases which range from black\n     ÃƒÂº metal to progressive rock and everything in between, a\n     ÃƒÂº lot of times the bands we are interested in never get\n     ÃƒÂº any attention because they aren't trying to fit into the\n     ÃƒÂº current mold of mainstream music.  Regardless of what\n     ÃƒÂº people at the RIAA, or the bands themselves might think,\n     ÃƒÂº we don't do this to take money away from artists.  In\n     ÃƒÂº fact, if anything, by releasing music from these artists,\n     ÃƒÂº we hope to get them heard and potentially build up some\n     ÃƒÂº interest worldwide, and would like them to develop a\n     ÃƒÂº larger fanbase.\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº If you are taking the time to read this nfo and check out\n     ÃƒÂº this release, please consider the fact that the artist\n     ÃƒÂº you're going to listen to probably put a lot of effort\n     ÃƒÂº into releasing this piece of work.  If you really like\n     ÃƒÂº the band, listen to some of their other discs, research\n     ÃƒÂº them on the net, because all bands in the world have\n     ÃƒÂº potential to help someone obtain the mood that they're\n     ÃƒÂº searching for at any given time.  At times you hear\n     ÃƒÂº people say &amp;quot;so and so only rips lame shit&amp;quot;, or things\n     ÃƒÂº like &amp;quot;I hate them, they suck&amp;quot;, but keep in mind that\n     ÃƒÂº everyone in the world is different, and has different\n     ÃƒÂº tastes, not only in music, but in life as well. If you\n     ÃƒÂº don't like something a group releases, then nobody is\n     ÃƒÂº going to put a gun to your head and make you listen to\n     ÃƒÂº it (unless they're fucking psychos and need psychiatric\n     ÃƒÂº help), so don't put other groups down for releasing the\n     ÃƒÂº music they believe in, or treat them like they have\n     ÃƒÂº nothing to offer because you don't like some of their\n     ÃƒÂº releases.  If they release some things that aren't for\n     ÃƒÂº you, then so be it, wait until that release you've been\n     ÃƒÂº waiting for does come out, and if they never release\n     ÃƒÂº anything you like, there are lots of other groups out\n     ÃƒÂº there for you to check out.  Let all release groups\n     ÃƒÂº coexist together in peace without bashing each other\n     ÃƒÂº because of differing preferences, let's keep things as\n     ÃƒÂº friendly and secure as possible so that we may safely\n     ÃƒÂº continue doing what we love to do in the future,\n     ÃƒÂº release kickass music!\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº Remember... an album worth listening to, is an album worth buying!\n\n     ÃƒÅ¡Ã‚Â¿\n    ÃƒÅ¡Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â³\nÃƒÂºÃƒÂ¹ Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ‚¬Ã‚Â³Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž  ÃƒÂ¹    ÃƒÂº\n     Ã‚Â³Ã‚Â³\n  ÃƒÂºÃƒÂ¹Ãƒâ€ž|Ãƒâ„¢ G.R.E.E.T.I.N.G.S\n     ÃƒÂ¹\n     ÃƒÂº  4hm -/- amok -/- amnmp3 -/- berc -/- bos -/- butt -/- chr -/- cnmc\n     ÃƒÂº  cmg -/- csr -/- diss -/- doc -/- end -/- gf -/- gravewish -/- pms -/- radial\n     ÃƒÂº  rda -/- rns -/- ser -/- ss -/- ssr -/- tfa -/- ube -/- vic -/- wlm\n     ÃƒÂº\n     ÃƒÂº  Last but never least.. personal friends, and all other groups putting out\n     ÃƒÂº  quality releases within the MP3, 0-DAY, ISO, and VCD scenes.\n\n     ÃƒÅ¡Ã‚Â¿\n    ÃƒÅ¡Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â³\nÃƒÂºÃƒÂ¹ Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ‚¬Ã‚Â³Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž  ÃƒÂ¹    ÃƒÂº\n     Ã‚Â³Ã‚Â³\n  ÃƒÂºÃƒÂ¹Ãƒâ€ž|Ãƒâ„¢ C.O.N.T.A.C.T.I.N.G  A.M.R.C\n     ÃƒÂ¹\n     ÃƒÂº  AMRC IS looking for metal pre-release/promo rippers\n     ÃƒÂº  AMRC IS looking for 100mbit+ EU INTERNAL HQs or Dumpsites (50GB+)\n     ÃƒÂº  AMRC IS looking for access to IRC BNCs for the entire group\n     ÃƒÂº  AMRC IS NOT looking for couriers\n     ÃƒÂº  Come see us on IRC, we use 'cokaine' there ;)\n\nÃƒÂºÃƒÂº-Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€šÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž  Ãƒâ€ž Ãƒâ€ž Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž ÃƒÂ¹    ÃƒÂº                           ÃƒÅ¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž---ÃƒÂº\nÃ‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â³ header by creepah &amp;lt;CRO&amp;gt; - layout by members in 2001     Ã‚Â³Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°\nÃ‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â³ last modified on 9th of July 2002                       Ã‚Â³Ã‚Â±Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°Ã‚Â°\n ÃƒÂº--Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ„¢                             ÃƒÂº  ÃƒÂ¹ Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž Ãƒâ€ž Ãƒâ€ž  Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒï¿½Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž---ÃƒÂºÃƒÂº\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ba89294441c42c0e08947c2f7ccaddb710bcb1b","amp;dn":"Dragonforce+-+Valley+Of+The+Damned-Promo-2003-AMRC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ba89294441c42c0e08947c2f7ccaddb710bcb1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,168,146,148,68,28,66,192,224,137,71,194,247,204,173,219,113,11,203,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
