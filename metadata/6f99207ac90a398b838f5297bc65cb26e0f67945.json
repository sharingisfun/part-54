Problem is he gets less time with his family, and \n\nwishes for a remote in which he can control his life. This soon comes true for Newman, when \n\nhe meets Morty (Walken), a crazy sales clerk, who has the ultimate remote. A remote in which \n\nhe can do anything, including muting, skipping and dubbing his life. He finds this to be the \n\nopportunity in which he can not only skip every argument, but also skip to his promotion. He \n\nsees this as a good idea, until the remote goes horribly wrong. \n_________________________________________________________________________________\nTrivia:Drew Barrymore was initially cast as Donna Newman but due to various \nreasons could not do the film.\n\nWhen Michael Newman visits Ben Newmans office, the water that Ben gives Michael \nis VOSS sparkling artesian water from Norway.\n\nWhen Michael revisits his first kiss, Janine is wearing a Bart Simpson T-Shirt. \nMichael&amp;#039;s mother, Trudy, is played by Julie Kavner, who is the voice of Marge \nSimpson in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (1989).\n\nAs an in-joke, the names of some of the crew members are visible on a few \nheadstones at the graveyard scene near the end of the film.\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nCast:\n\nAdam Sandler\t ... \tMichael Newman\n\nKate Beckinsale\t... \tDonna Newman\n\nChristopher Walken\t... \tMorty\n\nDavid Hasselhoff\t... \tAmmer\n\nHenry Winkler\t... \tTed Newman\n\nHash: 6F99207AC90A398B838F5297BC65CB26E0F67945\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f99207ac90a398b838f5297bc65cb26e0f67945","amp;dn":"Click%5B2006%5D%5BEng%5D%5BDVDRIP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f99207ac90a398b838f5297bc65cb26e0f67945","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,153,32,122,201,10,57,139,131,143,82,151,188,101,203,38,224,246,121,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
