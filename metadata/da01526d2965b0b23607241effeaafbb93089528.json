Sadly, Getz died a few months after these sessions, the only collaboration between the two. Lincoln&amp;#039;s own songs represent the majority of material on the album; standouts include &quot;Bird Alone&quot; and &quot;When I&amp;#039;m Called Home.&quot; A deep sense of spirituality empowers much of this work, one the arises from the way in which Lincoln melds the emotional bearing of blues with the more cerebral forays of jazz. She&amp;#039;s backed by a superlative trio of Hank Jones on piano, Charlie Haden on bass, and Mark Johnson on drums. This is an essential title for anyone interested in either Abbey Lincoln or Stan Getz.\n\nPersonnel\nAbbey Lincoln :Vocal\nStan Getz :Tenor Saxophone\nHank Jones :Piano\nCharlie Haden :Bass\nMark Johnson :Drums\nMaxine Roach (1, 10) :Viola\n\nSong List:\n1.Bird Alone - 08:33\n2.I&amp;#039;m In Love - 06:11\n3.You Gotta Pay The Band - 04:47\n4.Brother, Can You Spare A Dime? - 06:45\n5.You Made Me Funny - 03:00\n6.And How I Hoped For Your Love - 03:35\n7.When I&amp;#039;m Called Home - 05:24\n8.Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams - 06:26\n9.
