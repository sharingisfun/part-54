Current members consist of frontman Chris O&amp;#039;Connor, who performs vocals, guitar, and bass; percussionist Tim Lauterio; and Luke McAuliffe, who contributes various additional instrumentation (guitars, violins, piano) as well as much of the art that has appeared on the band&amp;#039;s albums and website. Former member Jeff Sparks wrote, sang, and played bass before leaving the band to pursue other music projects in 2001.\n\nThe band is best known for their 1996 hit &quot;Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand.&quot;\n\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Women&quot; (4:18)\n   2. &quot;Motherfucker&quot; (5:20)\n   3. &quot;Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth with Money in My Hand&quot; (5:38)\n   4. &quot;Who Say&quot; (3:24)\n   5. &quot;The Rise and Fall of Ooo Mau&quot; (3:50)\n   6. &quot;Where the Monkey Meets the Man&quot; (4:17)\n   7. &quot;Are You Happy?&quot; (5:35)\n   8. &quot;Chain Reaction&quot; (4:47)\n   9. &quot;Skin Turns Blue&quot; (4:27)\n  10. &quot;Rocket&quot; (4:42)\n\n\nThe Primitive Radio Gods&amp;#039; smashing chart debut &quot;Standing Outside a Broken Phone Booth With Money in My Hand&quot; was an unforgettable radio mainstay and MTV favorite during the summer of 1996. It quickly defined the band as another alterna-rock innovator integrating catchy hooks and a hip-hop/new wave mix. The debut album Rocket went gold, and earned the band top spots across the album and singles charts as well. Not too bad for frontman Chris O&amp;#039;Connor. This was a rock &amp; roll fantasy come true for this air traffic controller, whose side gig, the I-Rails, had been struggling for ten years prior. However, the hype surrounding the PRG quickly faded. Music industry politics played into the scheme and before the new millennium dawned, and the band&amp;#039;s sophomore effort was scrapped and the band was dropped from Columbia. Another quickie deal from Hi-Fi/Sire Records came to the rescue, but that too failed when contractual differences and a shift in bandmates created more chaos for the PRG. A whirlwind time, more than three years since their debut, and the band played on. In early 2000, PRG resurfaced with a complete roster including Jim Sparks, Tim Laurterio, and Luke McAuliffe. A deal with What Are Records? marked the second coming of this stereotyped one-hit wonder, and the long awaited follow-up, White Hot Peach, was issued in early 2001.\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.
