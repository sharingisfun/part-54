From Euro to Retro, Trip Hop to House, Big Beat to Trance \\&quot;title\\&quot; grabs bits from it all. With the assistance of producer John Punter (Roxy Music, Japan, Bryan Ferry) title couldn\\&amp;#039;t go wrong. His internationally respected producing skills shine on this record beyond comprehension.\n\n\nTracks:\n1. Moonfly\n2. Wednesday\n3. Oh Yeah\n4. La La Land\n5. Touch the Sky\n6. And I Wonder\n7. Magical (Retro)\n8. Delirious\n9. Never\n10. Sway\n11. Just Can\\&amp;#039;t Get Enough [Boomtang Boys Dance Remix]\n\nBonus Tracks:\n12. Wednesday [Boomtang Remix]\n13. Title - Wednesday (BeeZed soft Radio Mix)\n14. title - Wednesday (peace on moon remix)\n\n\n\nInject Depeche Mode with a shot of happiness, or Coldplay with some electronic beats and computer-induced sounds, and you have the essence of Title. Songwriter and beatmaster Hugo Bugg (aka DJ Laketrout) laces the tracks, while Dileas provides good-natured vocals. Comparisons to Erasure, the Pet Shop Boys, Royksopp, and Aqua come to mind. Title\\&amp;#039;s last album \\&quot;Moonfly\\&quot; was completed with producer John Punter. After a much deserved rest, the boys are back at work recording a string of new tracks due out for the summer of 2008.\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42e66bfbf8ecd32e2d8b5b67fe6e35b61e0a5ff7","amp;dn":"title+-+moonfly+%28INDIE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42e66bfbf8ecd32e2d8b5b67fe6e35b61e0a5ff7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,230,107,251,248,236,211,46,45,139,91,103,254,110,53,182,30,10,95,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
