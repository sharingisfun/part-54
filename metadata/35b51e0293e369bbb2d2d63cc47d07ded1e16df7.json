The Raiders hadn't had a Top 40 hit in two years and hadn't been in the Top 10 for four years when they scored the only No. 1 single of their career with &quot;Indian Reservation.&quot; [Trivia alert: Does anyone remember Don Fardon's original version of this song from three years earlier when it peaked at No. 20?] Tommy James had more than a dozen hits in the Sixties, but as a solo &quot;Draggin' the Line&quot; was his only Top 10 chart entry. And talk about coming back from the dead! The Fortunes previous hits (&quot;You've Got Your Troubles&quot; and &quot;Here It Comes Again&quot;) were from 1965 before making their final chart appearance with the classic &quot;Here Comes That Rainy Day Feeling Again.&quot; Even Hamilton, Joe Frank &amp; Reynolds got their start in the Sixties as part of the studio group The T-Bones of &quot;No Matter What Shape&quot; fame.\n\nNow, as far as the one-hit wonders go, it's a double-edged sword. On the one hand these are infrequently anthologized songs, but some of them were only minor hits. &quot;Games&quot; only reached No. 27 and &quot;Burning Bridges,&quot; which came from the film &quot;Kelly's Heroes&quot; fared even worse at No. 37. &quot;Chase&quot; did little better at No. 24, but most people will recognize this because every pep band in the country had this in their repertoire. And does anyone really identify &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; (No. 16) with Richie Havens? In fact, the only Top 10 one-hit wonder was Daddy Dewdrop's &quot;Chick-A-Boom (Don't Ya Jes' Love It).&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35b51e0293e369bbb2d2d63cc47d07ded1e16df7","amp;dn":"Super+Hits+Of+The+Seventies+-+Have+a+Nice+Day+Vol.+5+of+25","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35b51e0293e369bbb2d2d63cc47d07ded1e16df7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,181,30,2,147,227,105,187,178,210,214,60,196,125,7,222,209,225,109,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
