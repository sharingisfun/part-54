Anyway, I'd like to think that having done lowpass filtering digitally could be better than having done none.\nAnyway it sounds great for me, hope you like it too.\nPhotos of cover and labels are included.\nReleased by parafin.\n\nTracklist:\n01-Everything Counts (Live [Single Version]).flac\n02-Nothing (Live).flac\n03-Sacred (Live).flac\n04-A Question Of Lust (Live).flac\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ad5418e8f65b6196c8185afbf81af9a2d12f2a7","amp;dn":"Depeche+Mode+-+12BONG16+-+Everything+Counts+Live+%281989%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ad5418e8f65b6196c8185afbf81af9a2d12f2a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,213,65,142,143,101,182,25,108,129,133,175,191,129,175,154,45,18,242,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
