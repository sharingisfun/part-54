With\nthe rest of Lacuna Coil&amp;#039;s lineup in place -- courtesy of\nAndrea Ferro (vocals), Cristiano Migliore (guitars), Marco\nCoti Zelati (bass), and Christiano Mozzati (drums) -- the\nband&amp;#039;s first full-length, In a Reverie, was issued in\n1999. The Halflife EP appeared in 2000, and their next LP,\nUnleashed Memories, followed in spring 2001.\n\nThe group&amp;#039;s third album, Comalies, was highly praised by\nthe metal world after its release in October 2002, and\nattention surrounding Lacuna Coil continued to grow as\nthey spent time on the road with Type O Negative, P.O.D.,\nOpeth, and Danzig, among others. &quot;Heaven&amp;#039;s a Lie&quot; was also\na U.S. commercial radio success as the album&amp;#039;s first\nsingle, followed by the equally popular &quot;Swamped.&quot; The\nband accepted an invitation to appear at 2004&amp;#039;s Ozzfest,\nand spent the next year playing at many European\nfestivals.
