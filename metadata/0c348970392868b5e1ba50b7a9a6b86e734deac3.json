Yeah!\n\nThis is a bootable ISO constructed from the official Tablet PC 2005 Edition Release.  Tablet PC Components were removed, as well as upgrade support for Windows 98/2000/ME so it would fit on one cd.  \n\nC3R1AL is automatically entered; includes aktiv8shun patch.\nTested &amp; Working!\n\n[EDIT] Just to be clear, this IS NOT Media Center 2005 Edition, which will be released somewhere between October and November.\n\nPost some feedback!  And let it seed for a while!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c348970392868b5e1ba50b7a9a6b86e734deac3","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+MCE+2004+%5BSP2-RTM%5D+%5BMedia+Center+Edition%5D+%5BModified+T","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c348970392868b5e1ba50b7a9a6b86e734deac3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,52,137,112,57,40,104,181,225,186,80,183,169,166,184,110,115,77,234,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
