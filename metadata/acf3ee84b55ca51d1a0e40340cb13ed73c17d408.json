DeMille. This overripe melodrama purports to be life inside the Ringling Brothers Circus; maybe it&amp;#039;s not, but the circus ought to be like this. The actors wrestling with the purple dialogue are: early-career Charlton Heston, as the tough-as-nails circus manager; Cornel Wilde and Betty Hutton as trapeze artistes; and Gloria Grahame (who won an Oscar), dangling from elephants. Best of all, James Stewart plays a clown who--for mysterious reasons--never removes his makeup. (Stewart took the supporting role simply because he&amp;#039;d always wanted to play a clown.) This is a fried-baloney sandwich of a movie: it ain&amp;#039;t sophisticated, and probably isn&amp;#039;t good for you, but once you start you can&amp;#039;t stop. It was the box-office champ of 1952, and it shocked everybody by winning the best picture Oscar.\n\nDVD RIP\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044672/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0044672/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acf3ee84b55ca51d1a0e40340cb13ed73c17d408","amp;dn":"THE+GREATEST+SHOW+ON+EARTH-++CIRCUS+EPIC+DVD+RIP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acf3ee84b55ca51d1a0e40340cb13ed73c17d408","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,243,238,132,181,92,165,29,26,14,64,52,12,177,62,215,60,23,212,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
