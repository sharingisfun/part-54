Vincent\n       is a contract killer. When an off-shore narco-trafficking\n       cartel learns that they're about to be indicted by a federal\n       grand jury, they mount an operation to identify and kill the\n       key witness, and the last stage is tonight. It is on this very\n       night that Vincent has arrived--and five bodies are supposed\n       to fall. Circumstances cause Vincent to hijack Max' taxicab,\n       and Max becomes collateral--an expendable person who's in the\n       wrong place at the wrong time. Through the night, Vincent\n       forces Max to drive him to each assigned destination. And as\n       the L.A.P.D. and F.B.I. race to intercept them, Max and\n       Vincent's survival become dependent on each other, in ways\n       neither would have imagined.\n\n\n -  - ------------ [ -               Cast                - ] ------------ -  -\n\n\n       Tom Cruise.......................................Vincent\n       Jamie Foxx...........................................Max\n       Jada Pinkett Smith.................................Annie\n       Mark Ruffalo.....................................Fanning\n       Peter Berg...............................Richard Weidner\n       Bruce McGill.....................................Pedrosa\n       Irma P.
