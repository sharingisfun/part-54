Realistic weapon setup\n  includes over a dozen real-life guns, all fitting the crime-story\n  setting like a bullet in the head. The action is surrounded with more\n  than 80 hand-painted comic-screens that enhance the game's gritty\n  atmosphere and attitude, introduce the game's murderous cast of\n  characters, and carry the plot from one location to the next. When\n  darkness falls in New York City tonight, a lone man will go through\n  hell to avenge his loves ones only to discover that the answers he\n  seeks can hurt more than having no answers at all. Against all odds,\n  back against the wall, and with no one to trust Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ Max Payne. A man\n  with nothing to lose. \n\n  * Max Payne is a story-driven 3rd person action game aimed for a\n    mature audience. \n\n  * Two camera modes show the grim present day New York City setting\n    and the gunplay action from the best possible angles. The follow-up\n    mode tails Max Payne, as he runs, his guns blazing and his long\n    leather jacket flapping, through trash littered alleys and cockroach\n    crawling hotel rooms. \n\n  * Realistic weapon setup includes over a dozen real-life guns, all\n    fitting the crime-story setting like a bullet in the head. \n\n  * The action is surrounded with more than 80 graphic novel storyboards\n    that enhance the game's dark and gritty atmosphere and attitude,\n    introduce the game's murderous cast of characters and carry the\n    twisting roller coaster plot from one action location to the next. \n\n  * Uses new MAX-FT Technology. \n\n  * Smooth character system that allows seamless characters meshes with\n    a wide range of movement. Characters naturally receive lighting\n    properly from the environment. \n\n  * Particle systems. Remedy's ParticleFX editor lets the user create\n    different particle systems that can be used real-time within the\n    game. \n\n  * Full Radiosity Lighting. The lighting has never been this realistic.\n    MAX-FX Radiosity Lighting photo-realistically reflects the light\n    and casts shadows in the environment. \n\n\n  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is\n  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail\n  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release,\n  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so\n  we think a future mod will work with this release.\n\n  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to \n  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.  \n  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2. \n\n  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option, \n  choose &amp;quot;MODE1/2048&amp;quot;, exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM.\n  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but \n  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine.\n\n  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RW's\n  and CD-RW's, so if you want to be sure that these will work\n  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable\n  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some\n  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.\n\n-X-- --- - ----------- -- -------- - - -- ------------- -------- --- --X-\n\n                _____ _____  ____   /____   __  ___/___  /\n               /_____)_____)/     //__    /      /    /\n           _ _/    /   _  /______/______/______/     /\n                              ___/              /        _ _\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:130f99e938f05ca262352a017a4b4a9fd51fdc91","amp;dn":"Max+Payne+XBOX-ProjectX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"130f99e938f05ca262352a017a4b4a9fd51fdc91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,15,153,233,56,240,92,162,98,53,42,1,122,75,74,159,213,31,220,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
