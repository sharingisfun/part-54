Far Cry sold 730,000 units within four months of release and has currently sold over 1 million copies worldwide. The game's story follows an ex-Special Forces man named Jack Carver, who is stranded on a mysterious archipelago in Micronesia. He is searching for a female journalist he was escorting after she went missing when their sailboat was destroyed by mercenaries.\n\nOn April 8, 2004, Ubisoft announced Far Cry Instincts for the Xbox, GameCube and PlayStation 2 systems. Far Cry Instincts graphically resembles Far Cry, but is more of an attempt to remake the game to satisfy the console shooter community. The PS2 and GC ports were later cancelled. Far Cry Instincts is now exclusive to Xbox and was released to wide acclaim on September 27, 2005, in North America. Another version, Far Cry Instincts: Predator is also available for the Xbox 360. On March 28, 2006, Ubisoft released a sequel, Far Cry Instincts: Evolution for the Xbox, which was met with less enthusiasm than the first version of Far Cry. A game based on the franchise was released as part of Ubisoft's launch lineup for the Wii (Far Cry Vengeance). In the Wii version, the Wii Remote is used for many of the tasks assigned to buttons in previous iterations of the game, including driving vehicles, shooting, and running. Far Cry 2 has been officially announced by Ubisoft, although it will not be developed by Crytek, but by Ubisoft's Montreal studio. \n\nThe FarCry Assualt Co-op LAN Mod, recently released, is a work of software- \nengineering art. In its finished form the FarCry Assualt Co-op LAN Mod overcame  \nthe one-hundred kilobyte-a-second bandwidth limit allowing for Co-op game play  \nwithout Lag. As a consequence of this many of the Author's new maps contain a  \nveritable army of lagless enemie bots (300). This is a major accomplishment and the Federation has been deeply impressed by the author's work. Unfortunately the Far Cry Campaign Co-op Mod, also included in this release, while working is  \ncurrently merely a Public Beta release, full of glitches too numerous to  \ndocument in this NFO (most strikingly the inability to change levels without  \nreloading the server). This release also contains the Model Hack Mod, and  \nadditional player models allowing players to play as any of the single player  \ncampaign models as well as a extensive assortment of user created models. This  \nfeature is not available in the Far Cry Campaign Co-op Mod.\n\nThis release currently allows up to four players to go through the main campaign, or four large co-op maps on various difficulty settings through a VLAN or LAN configuration, without needing to purchase Far Cry. \n \n\nThis release possesses the following advantages over its predecessor:\n\n(1.) It has been updated and now makes use of the newest high-definition  \nlighting and graphics. It also contains new (in addition to the content  \ncontained in the two aforementioned mod) icons, and player models.\n(2.) It is now portable, thereby simplifying installation considerably.\n(3.) Many unnecessary files from the earlier releases have been removed,  \nthereby greatly shrinking the size of this release (over a Gigabyte).\n(4.) It has been updated with hundreds of bug fixes, most noticeably the removal \nof the bandwidth limit.\n\n\nThis is the final Federation Far Cry release as we intend to shift focus to Crysis Co-op (by the same author), when the mod becomes available. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Miscellaneous Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease Note The Following:\n\n.I.\nThe Federation takes no responsibility for any damage that may come to your computer through the trial of this game. This mod has been tested to work \non Windows XP and Vista. No support or technical assistance will be provided. \nEver. Creation of this release took ten hours of unpaid labour. \n.II.\nThe mod itself was made by flamenight 7 in conjunction with many\nmoders and testers at the CryMod Forums (http://www.crymod.com/portal.php).\nNone of the above mentioned individuals support or condone software piracy. The Federation has released their work without their permission.\n.III.\nThis game can work on single player featuring the main campaigns or through the co-op mod. The two functions unlike most coop mods CAN be played simultaneously. Instructions to play the games on both settings are listed in the &quot;Install Notes&quot; section of this NFO.\n.IV.\nI am ZKZ. \nI am an INDEPENDENT member of the FEDERATION group. \nProps to the scene.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteps:\n\n(1.) Extract the &quot;Far Cry - Co-op.rar&quot; file to a directory of your choice and then Navigate to the extracted directory (by default the &quot;Far Cry - Co-op&quot; directory). Double-click on the &quot;Far-Cry_Mod-Crack_ZKZ.exe&quot;program. This program is not necessary as it only installs shortcuts (makes no changes to the game files which are already updated, modded, and cracked).\n(2.) Click through the installation instructions. Make certain that you install \nthe Mod-Crack to the &quot;Far Cry&quot; directory which is located inside the &quot;Far Cry - Co-op&quot; directory you extracted.\n(3.) Open the desired shortcut (which by default is) located on your desktop to \nstart the game. In the &quot;Mods&quot; submenu load the desired mod (either the basic game, &quot;Campaign Co-op&quot;, or &quot;Assault Co-op&quot;). In the &quot;Multi-Player&quot; submenu create or join a game.\n\nShortcut Information:\n\n&quot;Far Cry - Co-op&quot;                - Multiplayer Far Cry Co-op\n&quot;Far Cry - Server&quot;      \t - Multiplayer Far Cry Server\n\nNotes:\n\nExtra content, including game covers, and the official manual, are located in the &quot;X:Far Cry - Co-opFar CryExtras&quot; directory.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  In The Pipeline\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nT-BOX - ZKZ of the Federation Team\n\nGames - Pending\nEMUs  - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nTest  - Complete\n\nThis release is imminent. This project seeks to combine a Lite (less than 700m)\nVista build, bootscreen, frontend, registry tweaks, several related \napplications, twenty-plus emulators and tens of thousands of various game \nimages and ROMS in an orderly package. This package would then allow a user \nto easily create a SF personal computer (or any other light PC) that would \nact as any console from the first to sixth generation. This has been a huge\nundertaking but if it is successful this project will provide the PC scene with \nthe first real replacement for consoles. Please understand that projects like this one can have unsuspected kinks. Please be patient.\n\nHalf Life Decay Co-op - The Decay Team\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nWe are currently waiting for the Decay Team to release their Beta port (long \noverdue). Once they do, the game will be cracked (if necessary) and released A.S.A.P.\n\nQuake 4 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nAs many of you know opencoop recently released a tech demo of their next project Quake 4 Co-op which allows you to traverse most of the levels, with large amounts of lag, glitches, and crashes. Once they have a clean version working, this Crack-Mod will be released. Because we are waiting for them to finish their work there is no release date.\n\nQuake 2 Co-op - Co-op or Die\n\nGame  - Complete\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\nOver the past month Federation members have laboriously struggled to make past  \nreleases updated, thin, and portable. This release is in the works and is  \nexpected to be the last Federation Re-Release. No release date is set.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Recent Releases\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nFarCry Co-op - Assault/Campaign Co-op   |Quake II Ultimate Co-op - COOP or DIE\t\n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete \nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete \nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete \nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete \nURL   -\thttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n3791203\t \t\t\t\t|3792230/Quake_II_Ultimate_COOP_or_DIE_\n\nDiablo - Ultimate UPD*\t \t        |Sonic Comics Collection\n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Lib   - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|3933117/Sonic_Comics_Collection\n4260899\t\t\t\t\t|\n\nRoxio Easy Media Creator\t \t|Vampire Masquerade:Ultimate Bloodlines\n                                        |\nApp   - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\t\t\t\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|Test  - Complete\n3938149/ Roxio_Easy_Media_Creator_Suite_|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\n10_Multilanguage (Final)\t\t|4218464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_\n\t\t\t\t\t\nDoom 3 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop FINAL* |Half-Life Ultimate Co-op - Sven FINAL* \n\t\t\t\t\t|\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nMod   - Complete\t\t\t|Mod   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4218|URL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/ \n464/Doom_III_-_Ultimate_Co-op_(Final)   |4236344\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nHalf-Life 2 Co-op - Synergy UPD*        |Far Cry - A-C LAN Co-op FINAL*\n                                        |\nGame  - Complete\t\t\t|Game  - Complete\nCrack - Complete\t\t\t|Crack - Complete\nNFO   - Complete\t\t\t|NFO   - Complete\nTest  - Complete\t\t\t|Test  - Complete\nURL   - http://thepiratebay.se/tor/\t|URL   - Pending\n4262500/\t\t\t\t|\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\t\t\t    Scene Requests/Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nA New Era - The GamerGirl2 has returned!

Aimer - Often when computers load Far Cry for the first time the aimer will \nbe stuck. To get around this problem go to 'Options' from the main menu and under &quot;Control Options&quot; select &quot;defaults&quot;. Your aimer will now be active.\n\n(2.) Changing Levels - In the campaign Co-op mod in order to change levels you \nneed to restart the server. This bug cannot be fixed.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  Federal Rule\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIf you like this game, BUY IT.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a232292486287efab8e66ba1c8015b4151202f1","amp;dn":"Far+Cry+-+Assault+Co-op+%5BIncludes+Campaign+Co-op%5D+%5BPortable%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a232292486287efab8e66ba1c8015b4151202f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,35,34,146,72,98,135,239,171,142,102,186,28,128,21,180,21,18,2,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
