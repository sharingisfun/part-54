A good listener this one is.\n\n\n\nThere comes a time in every bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life where independence from the past must be declared. Ah-ha!, The Diplomats already did that with their debut Ã¢â‚¬Å“Instrumental Action SoulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, but the natural reaction to dust off your Booker T records to test out the tried-and-true influences line will likely be there just the same. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t waste your time! The Diplomats are way passed the point of simply homaging the past. These guys are jamming out a hybrid of the re-fried greasy southern soul-funk-du-jour with a healthy side of New Orleans street band vibe courtesy of Jim VinerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s outstanding drum work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86f2c8dfb375a43468151124955ab46af8d416eb","amp;dn":"Diplomats+Of+Solid+Sound+-+Let%C2%B4s+Cool+One+%28+estrus%2C+2003+%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86f2c8dfb375a43468151124955ab46af8d416eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,242,200,223,179,117,164,52,104,21,17,36,149,90,180,106,248,212,22,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
