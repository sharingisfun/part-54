Length : 107min                       \n\n\n Coach Fields is pathetic. He has the distinction of being the worst coach    \n in the history of sports anyone can recall. A loser of enormous              \n proportions, the incompetent and seemingly hopeless coach is convinced by    \n fellow coach Freddie Wiseman to return to the field for one last shot.       \n Assuring his long suffering wife that he will not ignore his family, Coach   \n moves them to Plainfolk, Texas where he hopes to redeem himself and his      \n reputation. Here he begins yet another attempt to improve his abysmal        \n record - this time as the coach of the football team at Heartland State      \n University. But he is saddled with a team of misfits - most of whom don&amp;#039;t    \n know the difference between a line of scrimmage and a line at the            \n cafeteria. Coach is in serious need of some real talent to beef up his       \n line-up and finds his number one recruit on the university&amp;#039;s baseball        \n diamond. The ever-so-handsome Lance Truman (Matthew Lawrence) brings with    \n him a distinguished award winning career - albeit for the most dropped       \n balls - as well as determination. Coach convinces Truman to join the team    \n as quarterback, and the young athlete comes on board despite the objection   \n of his father (Nick Searcy). Wearing jersey #1 is Trotter, the               \n bling-wearing, girl magnet wide receiver who can actually catch and run      \n with the ball, as long as his over-sized ego does not get in the way. The    \n biggest bruiser of the team is Buddy Boy, but he turns out to be more warm   \n and cuddly than the mean sonofabitch that Coach longs for. The rest of the   \n team includes the upbeat and handsome, Aseel Tare, who is always ready for   \n action despite an uncanny tendency for injury; tattooed and angry Jorge      \n Juanson who has a chip on his shoulder, and the delusion of being from the   \n barrio; Jizminder, a beautiful, British-Indian soccer player, who takes on   \n the role of kicker and is the only female player on the otherwise all male   \n squad; and lastly, is the runt of the group, Randy, who is always begging    \n for a chance to play despite his minuscule stature, and lack of any          \n discernible football skills...unless you count moxie. Serving as Coach&amp;#039;s     \n right hand man is IPod, although he is often misunderstood, the              \n good-hearted, music listening IPod keeps the team smiling. Although the      \n team and townsfolk are leery of the newcomer&amp;#039;s approach, the Coach uses his  \n unorthodox methods to whip this group of rag-tags into shape - both on and   \n off the field. While the audience follows their winding road to the          \n playoffs, the film pokes fun at the clichÃƒÂ©s and conventions of other sports  \n flicks. And the team does make progress, so much so that they actually make  \n it to the South-Southwest Conference Championship at the 2nd Annual Toilet   \n Bowl. Facing their fiercest opponents yet and yearning to win the big game,  \n The Comebacks face off with the Lone Star State Unbeatables. And as every    \n great sports team has always done, The Comebacks use ingenuity and           \n unorthodox measures in the final showdown where the best team wins.          \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f593e135f09e8d39030b91ed33350720fd4ebc4e","amp;dn":"The+Comebacks.WS.2007.XviD.HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f593e135f09e8d39030b91ed33350720fd4ebc4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,147,225,53,240,158,141,57,3,11,145,237,51,53,7,32,253,78,188,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
