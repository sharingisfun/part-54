After getting out of the car and walking along a path for a while, they discover an open-air restaurant filled with food but with no workers or customers present. Mom and Dad don&amp;#039;t hesitate to sit down and dig in, but Chihiro senses danger and refuses. As night falls, she is terrified to see the area fill with faceless spirits, but when she runs to find her parents, she discovers that they have been turned into pigs. She is found by a mysterious boy named Haku, who promises to help her. He gets her a job working in a nearby building, which turns out to be a bathhouse for the thousands of Japan&amp;#039;s gods and spirits. Though the work is hard and the people strange, she does as well as she can. Her parents, however, are still waiting in the hotel&amp;#039;s stockyard, and Chihiro must find a way to break the spell on them before they end up as the main course of some guest&amp;#039;s dinner.\n\n...187 Presents\n========================================\nName.........: Spirited Away...187.avi\nFilesize.....: 1,400 MB (or 1,434,200 KB or 1,468,620,800 bytes)\nRuntime......: 02:04:37 (179,259 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1119 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: ac3 (0x2000) Dolby Laboratories, Inc\nAudio Bitrate: 448 kb/s (6 ch) CBR \nFrame Size...: 720x400 (1.80:1) [=9:5]\n \nThis is a original ?187 ripped and compressed movie \n...187 is always there for people that keep it real.\nThose who are fake you know who you are...The NEW shout out is for you.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54cd30b2ccfb6a51c43cbe142b376b8a9614c454","amp;dn":"Spirited+Away...187","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54cd30b2ccfb6a51c43cbe142b376b8a9614c454","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,205,48,178,204,251,106,81,196,60,190,20,43,55,107,138,150,20,196,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
