Will only work in the Windows environment. Tested on Vista and XP where administrator blocked access to the CMD Prompt. Have not tested all the functionality. The source is this(For those who are afraid of a virus You will need to download the Python Interpreter at Python.org to use the source):\n\nimport os\nwhile 1:\n    os.system(raw_input(&amp;#039;c:\\your user here&gt;&amp;#039;))\n\n\n(easy huh?)\njust copy and paste the source into a text editor (NOT a word processor) and name the file whatever.py. The source will work on other OS&amp;#039;s.
