For the next few years, Powell went on to write, perform, mix and record two albums as this band, a dark industrial sound with a slight synth-pop edge. Years later while at a raucous Faint concert, Adam quite literally ran into Jen Plum, a singer and songwriter he quickly recruited for the new band, which was slowly becoming a strange amalgam of goth, industrial, rock and country. \n\nAfter the underground success of Phoenix, their first album together as the new and improved Thosquanta, the band has joined forces with [301STUDIOS] to release lovelife., a dark and heavy re-imagining of the project. Combining a wide variety of influences from goth and metal to hip-hop and industrial, the band has received comparisons ranging from Sister Machine Gun to The Sneaker Pimps. While the band name may not be easy to pronounce, its their ability to write a good pop song mixed with an extremely dark, electronic edge that has helped them emerge as one of the many artists grooming the Twin Cities for the electropunk takeover.\n\nTracklist:\n01 - Cowboy (Phoenix version)\n02 - Black Ag\n03 - Inch (Tease Me Mix by Heliosphere)\n04 - One Thousand Years\n05 - Inch\n06 - Simonize\n07 - Crush\n\nPhoenix (unreleased) - 01 - Double Data Rate\nPhoenix (unreleased) - 02 - Cowboy (Sunset Mix)\nPhoenix (unreleased) - 03 - Inch (Tease Me Mix by Heliosphere)\nPhoenix (unreleased) - 04 - Crush (OBCT Remix)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81f4564a6c0797f5d666cb34ef50b2f8b161ad7c","amp;dn":"%3E%3Ethosquanta%3C%3C+-+Phoenix+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81f4564a6c0797f5d666cb34ef50b2f8b161ad7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,244,86,74,108,7,151,245,214,102,203,52,239,80,178,248,177,97,173,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
