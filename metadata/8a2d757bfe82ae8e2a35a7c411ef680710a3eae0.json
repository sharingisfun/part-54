His old friends consist of Mesito (Spencer), a strong though somewhat immature brute of a fellow who loves food and a good fight; Augustus (Daly), a former dynamite man in The Dutchman&amp;#039;s platoon back in Cuba; and a silent and mysterious Japanese man nicknamed &quot;Samurai&quot; (Tetsuro Tamba), who is skilled with swords and knives. They are joined by The Dutchman&amp;#039;s young new friend Luis (Nino Castelnuovo), who used to be an acrobat. Gathered together, The Dutchman reveals his scheme, which seems like suicide: To rob $500,000 of gold from a train that is not only covered with soldiers equipped with rifles, machine guns, and a cannon, but traveling along a route that passes squadrons of armed soldiers on horseback every six minutes.\n\nThe rest you must watch for yourself to enjoy!!!!!\n\nWell, if you&amp;#039;ve already watched it when you were younger.....Treasure this WESTERN CLASSIC!!!\t\n\nTHIS IS A RE-UPLOAD INCASE YOU MISSED IT THE 1ST TIME.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a2d757bfe82ae8e2a35a7c411ef680710a3eae0","amp;dn":"Five.Man.Army-1969-Dario.Argento.SPAGHETTI.WESTERN-ASIAN.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a2d757bfe82ae8e2a35a7c411ef680710a3eae0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,45,117,123,254,130,174,142,42,53,167,196,17,239,104,7,16,163,234,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
