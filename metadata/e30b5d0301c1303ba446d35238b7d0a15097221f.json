Be prepared for something truly terribly enjoyable!\n\n\\&quot;Ok, lets start with this. Jellyfish is sacred. There are few bands in history that have such a short history, but such an amazing output of music. With that said, it takes some big kahunas to try to make a tribute CD to this band, and not have it suck. I can assure you, this certainly does not suck! The entire tribute CD will be out by late summer, but if this EP featuring tracks from the forthcoming tribute (along with some exclusive tracks) is any hint at the final product, it could very well be one of the best tributes CD ever. Highlights include threads \\&quot;Joining a Fan Club\\&quot;, which might even rock harder than the original, Edison Gower\\&amp;#039;s gorgeous \\&quot;The Glutton of Sympathy\\&quot;, and Ken Morrison\\&amp;#039;s nailing of \\&quot;Calling Sarah\\&quot;, among others. What amazes me about this EP is the production and attention to detail these artists have put into the tracks. Not only are they very talented artists, but you can tell that they really really like Jellyfish. Extremely impressive stuff!\\&quot; - Jay Anderson, Popbang Radio. A long-overdue tribute to Jellyfish? What on earth is there not to love and support about that? DonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t answer just pick this up and enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e30b5d0301c1303ba446d35238b7d0a15097221f","amp;dn":"Various+Artists+-+Sensory+Lullabies+%28The+Ultimate+Tribute+to+Jel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e30b5d0301c1303ba446d35238b7d0a15097221f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,11,93,3,1,193,48,59,164,70,211,82,56,183,208,161,80,151,34,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
