However, it was not the hurricane which caused the greatest human damage on America&amp;#039;s Gulf coast, but the overwhelmed public services.\n\nThe inability of the richest nation in the world to evacuate the poorest in the affected communities was highlighted to the world. What were also on display were the US&amp;#039;s inequalities, racism and broken political system.\n\nHosted by Avi Lewis, this week&amp;#039;s Frontline USA: New Orleans looks at how these issues are playing out in the swing state of Louisiana in the middle of a dramatic presidential campaign.\n\nFrontline USA is a new weekly programme taking an in-depth look at the real issues at stake in the US presidential election. Lewis will strip away the spin, and highlight real issues such as poverty, violence, race, health, and immigration.\n\nThe series will study the potential implications the US election will have for billions worldwide, getting the reactions from Baghdad to Beijing.\n\nLewis is one of Canada&amp;#039;s most controversial and eloquent media personalities, previously working as a documentary film-maker and hosting programmes on Canada&amp;#039;s CBC.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/2DCB45CD-2501-455C-9F38-81D8608ADA72.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/2DCB45CD-2501-455C-9F38-81D8608ADA72.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCap: shunster x-youtube \n\nSoS: http://www.sonofshun.com/forums/\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:731c218b6a629669abf4c177cb1d686ca0d6a387","amp;dn":"Frontline+USA%3A+Politics+of+Race%7ENOLA+%28Al-Jazeera%29+2008+02+23+SoS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"731c218b6a629669abf4c177cb1d686ca0d6a387","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,28,33,139,106,98,150,105,171,244,193,119,203,29,104,108,160,214,163,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
