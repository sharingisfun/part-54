Covers included.\n \nChristopher Maurice Brown [born May 5th 1989 in Tappahannock, Virginia], better known as Chris Brown, is an American pop and RnB singer, dancer, and actor who released his Billboard Hot 100 number-one debut single &amp;#039;Run It&amp;#039; in 2005, which was produced by Scott Storch and featured Juelz Santana. Brown was influenced by the artists which his parents played on the home radio, such as Michael Jackson and Sam Cooke. A dancer since the age of two, Brown was not aware of his vocal talents until the age of eleven. Before becoming a vocalist, he was interested in becoming a rapper. At thirteen, Brown was discovered by a local production team who visited his father&amp;#039;s gas station searching for new talent. Since then, he began his recording career and moved to New York, staying there for two years.\n\n&amp;#039;Exclusive&amp;#039; is the second studio album by pop/RnB singer Chris Brown. The album was originally going to be titled Graduation, but was renamed due to rapper Kanye West&amp;#039;s album going by the same name. The album was originally scheduled to be released August 28th 2007, but was pushed back to October 30th 2007, then pushed back even further to its final release date of November 6th 2007. The album was No.34 on Rolling Stone&amp;#039;s list of the Top 50 Albums of 2007. This sophomore effort from the teenaged RnB sensation dubbed &quot;the new Michael Jackson&quot; is the follow-up to his eponymous 2005 debut. Reuniting with many of the producers of that album, including Scott Storch and the Underdogs, he has contributed to the songwriting this time out, aiming for a slightly edgier, more mature sound - but has promised not to alienate his youthful core fanbase. Includes the singles &amp;#039;Kiss Kiss&amp;#039;, &amp;#039;Wall To Wall&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;With You&amp;#039;.\n\nTracks:\n01  Throwed\n02  Kiss Kiss [Ft.
