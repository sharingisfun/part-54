The audience was beautifully appreciative, and the band turned in an absolutely stunning performance, filled with some rarely-played gems. From the first notes of the show opener, Powderfinger, it was apparent that this would be a special night. The highlight for me was Witches, making the drive out and the previous night&amp;#039;s geese-fest all worth it. There isn&amp;#039;t a wasted moment in this entire show, and right after it ended I knew it would always be a favorite.\n\n \n\nThis is the first show from the lower-key 2002 tour in the SOTM download series. I hope you like it as much as I enjoyed it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0f2ef49aa5860153b42bc7de66fe7bc2197579c","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies+2002-10-12+%40+Des+Moines+Civic+Center+-+Des+Moines","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0f2ef49aa5860153b42bc7de66fe7bc2197579c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,242,239,73,170,88,96,21,59,66,188,125,230,111,231,188,33,151,87,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
