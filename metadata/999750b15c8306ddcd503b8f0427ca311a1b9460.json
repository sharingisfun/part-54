The short interview/making of sequence following the filmette added to the enjoyment when you saw the number of people and the amount of effort which went into filming some thumbs (and one foot).\n\n    It's true that some of the jokes made are pretty much standard fare (Leah is Princess Bunhead - with cinnamon buns for hair, a Stormtrooper comments on Darth Vader's &amp;quot;cool&amp;quot; voice). However, the curious effect of faces superimposed on thumbs, some of the attention to detail and references to the original (the bar scene), and some of the just plain whacked out humour (the naked X-wing pilot) are what maintain the pace.\n\n    2 minutes longer and I think I would have begun to lose interest, but for something different and a good laugh Thumb Wars does the job. The preview for Thumb Tanic looked good too.\n\n-- http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0206341/\n\n\n\nspeltid: 21m45s\n\ninte vÃƒÂ¤rldens bÃƒÂ¤sta kvalitÃƒÂ©, men det duger. filmen ÃƒÂ¤r vansinnigt bra!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:999750b15c8306ddcd503b8f0427ca311a1b9460","amp;dn":"thumb+wars%3A+the+phantom+cuticle+%28grym+star+wars-parodi+av+steve","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"999750b15c8306ddcd503b8f0427ca311a1b9460","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,151,80,177,92,131,6,221,205,80,59,143,4,39,202,49,26,27,148,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
