Length : 122min                    \n\n\n In rural Texas, welder and hunter Llewelyn Moss discovers the remains of     \n several drug runners who have all killed each other in an exchange gone      \n violently wrong. Rather than report the discovery to the police, Moss        \n decides to simply take the two million dollars present for himself. This     \n puts the psychopathic killer, Anton Chigurh, on his trail as he              \n dispassionately murders nearly every rival, bystander and even employer in   \n his pursuit of his quarry and the money. As Moss desperately attempts to     \n keep one step ahead, the blood from this hunt begins to flow behind him      \n with relentlessly growing intensity as Chigurh closes in. Meanwhile, the     \n laconic Sherrif Ed Tom Bell blithely oversees the investigation even as he   \n struggles to face the sheer enormity of the crimes he is attempting to       \n thwart.                                                                      \n                                                                              \n\n\n                           Happy Hacker Industries                            \nThis movie should play fine on most DVD/DivX Certified settop\ndvd players.
