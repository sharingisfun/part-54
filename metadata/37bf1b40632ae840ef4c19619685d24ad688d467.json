CD Covers &amp; Music Video included\n\nPanic at the Disco [often shortened to merely PATD] is a band that originated in Las Vegas, Nevada, USA. They got the name from the lyrics of a song called &amp;#039;Panic&amp;#039;, by Name Taken. Their sound incorporates elements of pop, electronica, dance, and rock, along with many other genres. Their 2005 debut album, &amp;#039;A Fever You Can&amp;#039;t Sweat Out&amp;#039;, reached No.13 on the US Billboard 200, and has sold over 2.2 million copies since its September 2005 release.\n\n&amp;#039;Pretty Odd&amp;#039;. is the second studio album by rock band Panic at the Disco, to be released in the United Kingdom and New Zealand on March 24th 2008, in the United States on March 25th and in Australia on March 29th on the record label Fueled by Ramen. A more melodic outlook was evident when the Vegas emo-rockers toured last summer, and this album confirms their growth, venturing into folk, funk and fiddle-powered country. Their vaudevillian streak remains, but &amp;#039;Nine In The Afternoon&amp;#039; is a Beatles-esque tour-de-force and &amp;#039;She&amp;#039;s A Handsome Woman&amp;#039; a punk-pop gem. The album&amp;#039;s first single, &amp;#039;Nine In The Afternoon&amp;#039;, was released on January 29th 2008, and at the time of writing [March 22nd 2008] is at No.13 in the UK Singles chart.\n\nTracks:\n01  We&amp;#039;re So Starving\n02  Nine In The Afternoon\n03  She&amp;#039;s A Handsome Woman\n04  Do You Know What I&amp;#039;m Seeing\n05  That Green Gentleman [Things Have Changed]\n06  I Have Friends In Holy Spaces\n07  Northern Downpour\n08  When The Day Met The Night\n09  Pas De Cheval\n10  The Piano Knows Something I Don&amp;#039;t Know\n11  Behind The Sea\n12  Folkin&amp;#039; Around\n13  She Had The World\n14  From A Mountain In The Middle Of The Cabins\n15  Mad As Rabbits\n\nTHE VIDEO [XviD SkidVid] \nRipped from disc, edited, no logos and encoded 720x394 XviD\n\nPanic At The Disco - Nine In The Afternoon [2008] Music Video\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37bf1b40632ae840ef4c19619685d24ad688d467","amp;dn":"Panic+At+The+Disco+-+Pretty+Odd+%5B2008%5D%5BCD%2BMusic+Vid%2BCovers%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37bf1b40632ae840ef4c19619685d24ad688d467","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,191,27,64,99,42,232,64,239,76,25,97,150,133,210,74,214,136,212,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
