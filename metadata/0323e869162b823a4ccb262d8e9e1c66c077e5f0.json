July 17, 1959) was an American jazz singer and songwriter.\n\nNicknamed Lady Day by her sometime collaborator Lester Young, Holiday was a seminal influence on jazz, and pop singing. Her vocal style ? strongly inspired by instrumentalists ? pioneered a new way of manipulating wording and tempo, and also popularized a more personal and intimate approach to singing. Critic John Bush wrote that she &quot;changed the art of American pop vocals forever.&quot; She co-wrote only a few songs, but several of them have become jazz standards, notably &quot;God Bless the Child,&quot; &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Explain,&quot; and &quot;Lady Sings the Blues.&quot;\nContents\n\n\n\n\n.ooOO ROSA MANNEN 2008 OOoo.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0323e869162b823a4ccb262d8e9e1c66c077e5f0","amp;dn":"Billie+Holiday+-+Saddest+Tale+%28Live+Astoria+Queens+1935%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0323e869162b823a4ccb262d8e9e1c66c077e5f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,35,232,105,22,43,130,58,76,203,38,45,142,158,28,102,192,119,229,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
