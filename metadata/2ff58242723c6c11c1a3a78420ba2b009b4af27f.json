When Dave Drayton notices \na strange mist on the lake, he thinks nothing of it. When his son, Billy \nDrayton, his neighbor Brent Norton, and himself travel to the supermarket, the \nunthinkable happens. On their way to the market, they see the army, the \nfirefighters, and the police, heading toward the mist. When he sees this Brent \nmentions something about &quot;Project Arrowhead&quot;, a secret military plan that no one \nknows about. As they are shopping, they see three army men walk in, just to pick \nup a few things then head toward the mist. All eighty of the store&amp;#039;s shoppers \nhad no clue what was going on until an old man runs in the market with a bloody \nnose and declares &quot;Something in the mist!&quot; He tells them to close the door. \nAbout five seconds after they do close the door, the entire store shakes, as \nthough it was lifted feet above the ground. When David is asked to check on the \ngenerator, the loading dock door was being pushed by something outside. Then \nthere was a groan heard by Dave. He asks three people to come with him. When \nNorm the bag-boy volunteers to go out, he is taken by a creature with large \nsquid-like tentacles that have mouths, teeth, and arms of their own. When Dave \nand the other three fight it off, they alarm everyone in the store what is out \nthere. After hearing this, Mrs. Carmody exclaims that it is the end of times and \nthat God is punishing them. People don&amp;#039;t believe it until Mrs. Carmody has \nalmost everyone in the store on her side. Does &amp;#039;Project Arrowhead&amp;#039; have anything \nto do with this? Will Dave Drayton, his son, and his friends make it out alive \nas they make their last stand against this destruction? Or will they be taken by \nthe demon-like creatures of &amp;#039;The Mist&amp;#039;?\n\nDirector: Frank Darabont\n\nWriters : Frank Darabont\n        : Stephen King\n\nCast    : Thomas Jane\n        : Marcia Gay Harden\n        : Laurie Holden\n        : Andre Braugher\n        : Nathan Gamble\n\nEnjoy the movie.\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Announcement\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBlueLady and I have joined forces which has resulted in the RoCK &amp; BlueLady RG\nThis will ensure more frequent releases and a higher standard of quality.\n \nRoCK and BlueLady\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Friend site\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPhoenix Release Group: http://www.phoenix-rg.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can find us both at: http://www.genesis-sp.com/forum/\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ff58242723c6c11c1a3a78420ba2b009b4af27f","amp;dn":"The.Mist%5B2007%5D.Dvdrip.Xvid.AC3%5B5.1%5D-RoCK%26BlueLadyRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ff58242723c6c11c1a3a78420ba2b009b4af27f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,245,130,66,114,60,108,17,193,163,167,132,32,186,43,0,155,74,242,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
