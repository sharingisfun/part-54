Sadly, mounting debts and (ironically) a stronger Canadian dollar, did it in.\n\nThe final edition of GOO&amp;#039;s BESM has recently been picked up by White Wolf publishing under their Arthause Imprint.  However, this version of the Tri_Stat system was made widely available for free download when it came out.   It&amp;#039;s gotten harder and harder to find a download source for it. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-stat&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tri-stat&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93dfd2458b4ab96705e1c3340326108793043cb6","amp;dn":"Tri-Stat+Core+System+Role-Playing+game+v2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93dfd2458b4ab96705e1c3340326108793043cb6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,223,210,69,139,74,185,103,5,225,195,52,3,38,16,135,147,4,60,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
