At the time, it was unusual for a movie to endorse the point of view of teenagers, but Ray and screenwriter Stewart Stern captured the youthful angst that was erupting at the same time in rock &amp; roll. Dean is heartbreaking, following the method acting style of Marlon Brando but staking out a nakedly emotional honesty of his own. Going too fast, in every way, he was killed in a car crash on September 30, 1955, a month before Rebel opened. He was no longer an actor, but an icon, and Rebel is a lasting monument.\n\nVideo quality: 96.6% of original.\nSubtitles: English, German, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Norwegian, Danish, Finnish, Portuguese, Hebrew, Polish, Greek, Czech, Turkish, Hungarian, Icelandic, Croatian, French, Italian, English for the hearing impaired, German for the hearing impaired.\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://us1.webpublications.com.au/static/images/shop/lo/1005300003lo.jpg&quot;&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447ba368b3731796fd6381e90849be02909e0700","amp;dn":"James+Dean+-++Rebel+without+a+Cause","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447ba368b3731796fd6381e90849be02909e0700","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,123,163,104,179,115,23,150,253,99,129,233,8,73,190,2,144,158,7,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
