After convincing his parents that he is truly sick, Ferris calls on his friend Cameron to join him for a day of hooky from school. Cameron agrees, reluctantly, because it means taking his father&amp;#039;s prized classic 1961 red Ferrari 250 GT convertible. They pick up Ferris&amp;#039;s girlfriend head for adventure in downtown Chicago -- all the while trying to outsmart and outrun the dean of students who has become wise to Ferris&amp;#039; plan.
