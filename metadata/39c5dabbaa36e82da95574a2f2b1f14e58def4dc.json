Players race down one-way courses consisting of streets based on real-life locations while avoiding various road hazards such as oncoming traffic and construction. Players can gain a temporary boost in speed by using nitrous oxide, otherwise known as &quot;N2O&quot; or simply &quot;Nitrous,&quot; a feature that was heavily emphasized in the The Fast and the Furious film. However, the player is limited to the number of times the nitrous boost can be used.\n\nCruis&amp;#039;n, like its arcade counterpart, allows players to customize and upgrade their cars&amp;#039; numerous features, such as spoilers, decals, neon lights, ground effects, and engines. However, players must purchase these upgrades with money earned from races.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39c5dabbaa36e82da95574a2f2b1f14e58def4dc","amp;dn":"Cruisn+%5BPAL%5D+%5BWii%5D+%5BMULTI5%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39c5dabbaa36e82da95574a2f2b1f14e58def4dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,197,218,187,170,54,232,45,169,85,116,162,242,177,241,78,88,222,244,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
