Or, if you want to, Installer and serial are included.\n\nMobile phones contain some of the most important evidence in criminal investigations. Law enforcement agencies around the world need every possible advantage to help solve crimes. In many instances, mobile phones contain the important incriminating evidence that legal investigators require to solve a case. MOBILedit! Forensic has changed the way this evidence is obtained and presented. It provides reports with tamper-proof and indisputable evidence in a court of law. This report details out every piece of information in the phone such as call history, list of contacts, messages, photos, voice recordings, video, files, calendar, tasks, notes etc. MOBILedit! Forensic is a must-have for any forensic agent looking for that extra edge.\n\n\nMore infos at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mobiledit.com/downloads.asp?show=forensic&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mobiledit.com/downloads.asp?show=forensic&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThe package contains the Istaller program, a serial file, a first Portable version built up using RunHiddenConsole.exe to start the Batch file that changes some values in Registry, runs the program and deletes the Registry values when exiting from the program. This is done just to avoid having the sloppy DOS window in the background. Some AVs complain with it recognizing RunHiddenConsole.exe as a malicious/potentially harmful program as it can be used to hide malicious behaviours. If it&amp;#039;s your case, or just don&amp;#039;t trust in the first one, just use the second version.\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce423e7ef5e01a4af7313b614af55244deb8391c","amp;dn":"MOBILedit%21+2.9.0.37+Forensic+plus+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce423e7ef5e01a4af7313b614af55244deb8391c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,66,62,126,245,224,26,74,247,49,59,97,74,245,82,68,222,184,57,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
