These birds are taken from their natural habitat to be sold as pets in North Amerca and Europe. The way these pouchers catch the wild birds, and care for the birds is nothing less then horrible.\n\nEveryone who owns a parrot, or thinks about getting one, should watch this movie. It clearly shows why you should buy your bird at a breeder, instead of saving some money and getting a wild bird at some discount store.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb52cc2c210613baca289f9a96882ccf070daf89","amp;dn":"The+wild+bird+trade+%5BDocu-Parrots%5D.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb52cc2c210613baca289f9a96882ccf070daf89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,82,204,44,33,6,19,186,202,40,159,154,150,136,44,207,7,13,175,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
