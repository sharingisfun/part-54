I missed a couple of days in there so I was forced to go to secondary sources.  As a result, the sound quality varies--normally these are all 128 Kbit/sec but the quality for some of the early ones is much higher (as high as 320 MBit/sec) and as a result, so is the disk size.  Included is M3U and embedded album cover.  If you like what you hear, I strongly urge you to join KCRW as a member or donate to the station(KCRW.com or at 89.9 FM in the LA area).
