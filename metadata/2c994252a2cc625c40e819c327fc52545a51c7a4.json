Flash back four days. He owes a loan shark to cover his brother&amp;#039;s debts (Michael&amp;#039;s own gambling habits have left him virtually broke). His law firm is negotiating a high-stakes merger, and his firm&amp;#039;s six-year defense of a conglomerate&amp;#039;s pesticide use is at risk when one of the firm&amp;#039;s top litigators goes off his meds and puts the case in jeopardy. While Michael is trying to fix things, someone decides to kill him. Who? Meanwhile, his son summarizes the plot of a dark fantasy novel.\n\n\n\nwww overget com\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c994252a2cc625c40e819c327fc52545a51c7a4","amp;dn":"Michael+Clayton%5B2007%5D%5BEng%5D%5BDVDRip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c994252a2cc625c40e819c327fc52545a51c7a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,153,66,82,162,204,98,92,64,232,25,195,39,252,82,84,90,81,199,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
