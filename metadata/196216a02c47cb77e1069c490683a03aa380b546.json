I was told that was originally an MD recording, so I included a FA screen for you all to look at and judge. It&amp;#039;s sad\nthat 8 years later I&amp;#039;m finding I got fucked on a lot of trades by worthless MP3 burns. This was also not done as DAO, so it has\nclicks between tracks which further makes me think it&amp;#039;s MP3 sourced. You be the judge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:196216a02c47cb77e1069c490683a03aa380b546","amp;dn":"Nine+Inch+Nails+04.30.2000+Montreal%2C+Quebec","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"196216a02c47cb77e1069c490683a03aa380b546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,98,22,160,44,71,203,119,225,6,156,73,6,131,160,58,163,128,181,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
