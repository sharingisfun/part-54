Four of the five tracks had already been included on past albums (1984&amp;#039;s self-titled debut, 1985&amp;#039;s FREAKY STYLEY, and 1987&amp;#039;s UPLIFT MOFO PARTY PLAN), while an explosive cover of Jimi Hendrix&amp;#039;s &quot;Fire&quot; was the only previously unreleased song, although it would turn up again on 1989&amp;#039;s MOTHER&amp;#039;S MILK. While it&amp;#039;s likely that longtime Peppers fans will already be familiar with the tracks, newcomers will enjoy a brief overview of Flea and company&amp;#039;s early years.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f8b4da10da2fc38bfbb8bfe99da36293582fc78","amp;dn":"Red+Hot+Chili+Peppers+-+%5B1988%5D+The+Abbey+Road+E.P.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f8b4da10da2fc38bfbb8bfe99da36293582fc78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,139,77,161,13,162,252,56,191,187,139,254,153,218,54,41,53,130,252,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
