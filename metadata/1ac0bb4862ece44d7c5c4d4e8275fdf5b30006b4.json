The band tends to fall into a rut with that, often playing the same songs each tour, but this night they did acoustic versions of &quot;Good Friday&quot; and &quot;Leaving Normal,&quot; the latter a personal favorite of mine. I think it has great lyrics, and I love the movie that they originally wrote it for.\n\n \n\nFinally, the &quot;I&amp;#039;ll Never Get Out of These Blues Alive&quot; encore is pretty amazing. 2002 shows have been rather underrepresented in the downloads; we might have to change that!\n\n \n\nSo pull up a chair, spend a night downloading the show, and then listen. And if you haven&amp;#039;t yet registered for the 4thellamas.com message board, please do so while you&amp;#039;re waiting for your downloads to complete. That way you can vote for the download you want as a Christmas present!\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ac0bb4862ece44d7c5c4d4e8275fdf5b30006b4","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies+2002-06-11+%40+Coach+House+-+San+Juan+Capistrano%2C+C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ac0bb4862ece44d7c5c4d4e8275fdf5b30006b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,192,187,72,98,236,228,77,124,92,77,78,130,117,253,245,179,0,6,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
