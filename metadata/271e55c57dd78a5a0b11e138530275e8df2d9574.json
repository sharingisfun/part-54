Cookin&amp;#039; was the first to be released and it excited listeners not only with its contents but with its promise of more to come. Davis, Coltrane, Garland, Chambers, and Philly Joe: one of the classic groups in the history of jazz. It established a level of excellence that was to foster a long, successive line of outstanding Davis quintets and sextets through the Fifties and Sixties. From the muted eloquence of &quot;My Funny Valentine,&quot; through the fingerpoppin&amp;#039; &quot;Blues by Five,&quot; to the urgent swing of &quot;Airegin&quot; and &quot;Tune-Up,&quot; Cookin&amp;#039; has the ability to thrill the listener no matter how many times it is played-the mark of an all-time great performance.\n\nPersonnel:\nMiles Davis - Trumpet\nJohn Coltrane - Tenor saxophone\nPhilly Joe Jones - Drums\nRed Garland - Piano\nPaul Chambers - Bass\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.
