Nine half-hour episodes.\n\nRobert Neville is apparently the only survivor of an apocalypse caused by a pandemic of bacteria, the symptoms of which are very similar to vampirism. Every day he makes repairs to his house, boarding up windows, stringing and hanging garlic, disposing of vampires&amp;#039; corpses on his lawn and going out to gather any additional supplies needed for hunting and killing more vampires.\n\nThe 1954 novel has had a profound effect on the horror and science fiction genres. For instance, it is one of the first stories to try to explain vampirism scientifically. It also served as the inspiration for many other writers. Notable examples would be screenwriter and director George Romero who used the novel as inspiration for his film Night of the Living Dead, and Danny Boyle&amp;#039;s 28 Days Later.\n\nIt has been filmed four times, as The Last Man on Earth (1964), The Omega Man (1971), I Am Omega (2007) and I Am Legend (2007).\n\nMy recordings from BBC7.\n\n80kbps CBR single-channel mp3. Recorded in glorious mono, for CD quality sound at low bit-rates.\n\nPlease seed when you are done,\n\nSeymourDAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8b3288588bcda61be388fc90e3f190fe3da0c88","amp;dn":"I+Am+Legend+by+Richard+Matheson+-+BBC+Radio+-+SeymourDAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8b3288588bcda61be388fc90e3f190fe3da0c88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,179,40,133,136,188,218,97,190,56,143,201,14,63,25,15,227,218,12,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
