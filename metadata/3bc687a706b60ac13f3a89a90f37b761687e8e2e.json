This is why there are two tracks called &quot;Intro&quot; - one from the beginning of CD1, the other from CD2.  \n\nFrom Starfarer&amp;#039;s gig list, I&amp;#039;m positive it&amp;#039;s Fairfield Halls, Croydon, 25th March 2001.\n\nA month or so back I found I couldn&amp;#039;t play CD1, so I figured the CDR was damaged.  Using EAC I extracted it all to WAV to see what I could salvage.  Turned out aside from some jumps on the first &quot;Intro&quot; track, and a momentary blip about 12 seconds into &quot;Awakening&quot;, it&amp;#039;s fine.\n\nSo I encoded it to VBR MP3 using RazorLame 115.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s not a bad gig at all.  The stereo separation is good, and the vocals are very prominent. Bass &amp; Drums tend to take over a bit, probably due to the auto recording level of the tape-recorder,but overall I&amp;#039;d give it an 8.5/10.  There&amp;#039;s a lot of good-natured banter between songs, indicating the band are enjoying themselves here, and personally I think it&amp;#039;s a cracking version of &quot;Motorway City&quot;!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bc687a706b60ac13f3a89a90f37b761687e8e2e","amp;dn":"Hawkwind+-+Croydon+Fairfield+Halls+Rooms+25th+March+2001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bc687a706b60ac13f3a89a90f37b761687e8e2e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,198,135,167,6,182,10,193,63,58,137,169,15,55,183,97,104,126,142,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
