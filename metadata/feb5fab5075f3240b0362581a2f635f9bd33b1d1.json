According to legend, when the ravens  depart\nthe Tower  of  London,  it  will  crumble  to  rubble  and\ndisaster will befall England. As man became more dependent\non science, believing only in  what  he  could  define  or\ncreate, ancient knowledge and rituals  were  lost  to  the\nantiquity of time. Prophecies that had  stood  as  warning\nfor untold generations  were  seen  as  archaic  folly  or\nignorant superstition. So, when  the  harbingers  of  evil\nbegan to manifest, few saw and fewer  believed.  When  the\ndemons finally came, there was little that stood in  their\nway.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:feb5fab5075f3240b0362581a2f635f9bd33b1d1","amp;dn":"Hellgate.London-ViTALiTY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"feb5fab5075f3240b0362581a2f635f9bd33b1d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,181,250,181,7,95,50,64,176,54,37,129,162,246,53,249,189,51,177,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
