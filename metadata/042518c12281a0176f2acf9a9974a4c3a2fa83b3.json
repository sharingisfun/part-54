The half-grown cubs are learning the hunting and fighting skills they&amp;#039;ll need as adults. The cameras also give an insight into the worlds of other animals, with leopards presenting a real threat to the growing cubs, and deer making good hunting practice. The tigers head to a water hole to cool off on a steaming hot day, and the spy-cams show that the jungle pools are a magnet for a whole array of forest animals, including wild boars and sloth bears. But disaster strikes when both the cubs&amp;#039; parents are injured and a rogue male puts in an appearance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:042518c12281a0176f2acf9a9974a4c3a2fa83b3","amp;dn":"BBC.Tiger.Spy.in.the.Jungle.1of3.2008.PDTV.XviD.MP3.Remax.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"042518c12281a0176f2acf9a9974a4c3a2fa83b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,37,24,193,34,129,160,23,111,42,207,154,153,116,164,195,162,250,131,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
