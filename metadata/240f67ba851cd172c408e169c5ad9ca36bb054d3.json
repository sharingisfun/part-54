Modern metaphors and colloquialisms are always the most profound means of expressing age-old concepts.\n\nThe story begins with Shu In-wu (Lee Byung-Hun, star of Joint Security Area) meeting In Tae-hee (Lee Eun-Ju) by chance at a bus stop and offering her shelter under his umbrella until her bus comes. Unable to forget her, he returns to the same spot the next day hoping to find her. The sequence is handled poetically with time exposures and slow motion shots showing passersby fading into stills and vanishing like so many phantoms.\n************************************************************\nHey!
