Popular boy Zhang Shi Hao (Wilson Chen Bo Lin) is approached by Meng Ke Rou (Gwai Leon Mei), whose friend finds him attractive. Zhang believes that it's Meng who really is attracted to him, but as he gets to know the messenger of this youthful infatuation, deeper issues of sexuality and identity come to light. More might be at stake than just the first love between a boy and a girl, and the path one chooses may not be accepted by the society in which they live. Natural performances, elegant cinematography, and heartfelt, sensitive subject matter raise Yee Chin Yen's Blue Gate Crossing beyond boundaries of culture or sexuality, and into the realm of familiar human drama. A simultaneously sweet and surprisingly daring Taiwanese film, Blue Gate Crossing was nominated for Best Asian Film at the 23rd Annual Hong Kong Film Awards.\n\n\nOFFICIAL SITE:\nhttp://bluegatecrossing.kingnet.com.tw\n\n\nTRAILER:\nhttp://www.cinemovies.fr/medias/ba/B/bluegatecrossing_bavost_320.mov\n\n\nRELATED LINKS:\nhttp://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blue_gate_crossing\nhttp://www.indiepix.net/film/film.pl?film=1113\nhttp://www.villagevoice.com/film/0347,lim2,48761,20.html\nhttp://www.kinocite.co.uk/16/1693.php\n\n\nIMDB ENTRY: (7.6 Rating)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0333764 \n\n\nTORRENT DETAILS:\n700MB (2 Files)\nOriginal Audio w/ English Subs\n544 x 368 / XVID / MP3\n\n\nNOTE:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------++\nBe advised that I cannot stay online all the time.\nI may be offline for some hours, so please be patient with the seeding.\n\nPlease help me seed once you are finished.\nUpload what you've downloaded at least.
