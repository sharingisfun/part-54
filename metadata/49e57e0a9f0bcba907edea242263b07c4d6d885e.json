Applied a De-hum filter and a noise filter.  Re-encoded to 32 Kbps @ 22.05 KHz.  Editing done using Nero WaveEditor 4 by hand. Four hours duration before commercial edit takes it down to about 3 hours of playing time.  \n\nNote, in the 4th hour the audio cut out for about 2 minutes, then commercials came on and then the show started back.  I edited out the silence, but it does abruptly cut off in the middle of Alex speaking.  Must have been the NWO blocking something important!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49e57e0a9f0bcba907edea242263b07c4d6d885e","amp;dn":"Alex.Jones.Show.2008.07.01-chakra71","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49e57e0a9f0bcba907edea242263b07c4d6d885e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,229,126,10,159,11,203,169,7,237,234,36,34,99,176,124,77,109,136,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
