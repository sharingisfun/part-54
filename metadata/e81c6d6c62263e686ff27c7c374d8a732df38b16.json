For the next few years, Powell went on to write, perform, mix and record two albums as this band, a dark industrial sound with a slight synth-pop edge. Years later while at a raucous Faint concert, Adam quite literally ran into Jen Plum, a singer and songwriter he quickly recruited for the new band, which was slowly becoming a strange amalgam of goth, industrial, rock and country. \n\nThe (Young, Rich &amp; Out of Control) project quickly became an obsession of Thosquantas Adam Powell ever since the (lovelife) recording sessions came to an end in 2006. This rich album features each track from (lovelife) passed onto and remixed by a different artist. (Artists such as Caustic, Dissociate, Endless Blue, GNP, OBCT, Word Clock and many more.) A few tracks (these green vines) and (lovelife to be specific) have garnered two unique remixes each, providing fresh insight into songs we&amp;#039;ve come to know and love.\n\nTracklist:\n01. these green vines - Hentai Relations Mix (by Charles Sadler)\n02. these green vines - Hipsmithee Mix (by Dissociate)\n03. a is a - N Sometimes Y Mix (by OBCT)\n04. bad for me (by Jobot)\n05. split infinitive (by Caustic)\n06. jaded (by Bryantist)\n07. the lesser than - Less Than Godlike Mix (by Delta A.M.)\n08. lovelife - Regretful Threesome Mix (by The Eighth)\n09. lovelife (by Word Clock)\n10. day by day - Electroclash Mix (by Endless Blue)\n11. what you won&amp;#039;t - Rad Racer Mix (by GNP)\n12. random - Serendipitous Confluence Mix (by Evarial)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e81c6d6c62263e686ff27c7c374d8a732df38b16","amp;dn":"%3E%3Ethosquanta%3C%3C+-+Young%2C+Rich+%26+Out+of+Control+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e81c6d6c62263e686ff27c7c374d8a732df38b16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,28,109,108,98,38,62,104,111,242,124,124,55,77,138,115,45,243,139,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
