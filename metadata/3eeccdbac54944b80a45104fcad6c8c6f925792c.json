It had \nhorns, and had special ability that could be described as sixth sense. The \nmutant's had enough power to exterminate the whole human race. Afraid from their power, they were isolated into the national research facilities to be studied.\n\nHowever, by an accident, a girl of diclonius broke out of her confinement, killed the guards, and escaped from the laboratory. On her way to escape, she fell into the ocean and drifted to the city of Kamakura. There, she met Kota and Yuka. They named her Ã¢â‚¬Å“NyuÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and began to live with her.\n\n* Caution note from supers: This anime is VERY violent and its also uncensored, its not ment for the weak of heart.\n-----------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eeccdbac54944b80a45104fcad6c8c6f925792c","amp;dn":"Elfen+Lied+1-6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eeccdbac54944b80a45104fcad6c8c6f925792c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,236,205,186,197,73,68,184,10,69,16,79,202,214,200,198,249,37,121,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
