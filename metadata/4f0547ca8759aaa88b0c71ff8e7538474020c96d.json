This girl is the real deal, and if there&amp;#039;s any justice in the world, she&amp;#039;ll be huge.  If I had to describe her, I&amp;#039;d say if Chris Robinson impregnated Gwen Stefani and she was raised by Alannah Miles, that would be pretty close.  Her name is Sharon Little, her CD drops May 27, and you should all listen.  Let&amp;#039;s get behind this young lady and make sure we hear from her for a long, long time.  Yes, I taped her set.
