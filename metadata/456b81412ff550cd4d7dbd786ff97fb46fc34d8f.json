It is only when Constantinos discovers Alekos in bed with his wife that their friendship and their respective marriages finally collapse into a death spiral of sex, deceit and irrepressible humor. As events unfold another deception, one concealed by both men\\&amp;#039;s wives, opens the door to incredible erotic intrigue. Antonis Kafetzopoulos delivers a virtuoso performance in this surrealistic comedy about lies, friendship, love and deadlock.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDivx file, it can be used on your PS3, the quality is not the greatest but it\\&amp;#039;s good enough, definitely watchable. \n\nSpoken language is Greek, and there are no subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:456b81412ff550cd4d7dbd786ff97fb46fc34d8f","amp;dn":"O_Kalyteros_mou_Filos_%28My+Best+Friend%29+Divx+MPEG.44100Hz+stereo+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"456b81412ff550cd4d7dbd786ff97fb46fc34d8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,107,129,65,47,245,80,205,77,125,189,120,111,249,127,180,111,195,77,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
