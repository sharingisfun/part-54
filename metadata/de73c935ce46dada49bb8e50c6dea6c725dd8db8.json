They were on fire that night, and driving back through the plains of Kansas I got the idea for trying to make sure all these excellent shows got taped, which has led to this website!\n\n \n\nThis show from the Winter Waltz has some great performances. Margo alludes to being a little tired, and something about Disneyland, but I feel that the music shines regardless.
