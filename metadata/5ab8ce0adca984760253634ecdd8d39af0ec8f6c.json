The ensuing agony is captured in this spectacularly shot film, that exudes passion and humour and takes a refreshingly honest look at living 6 days in the vertical world.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ab8ce0adca984760253634ecdd8d39af0ec8f6c","amp;dn":"Blood%2C+Sweat%2C+and+Bagels++%28.avi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ab8ce0adca984760253634ecdd8d39af0ec8f6c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,184,206,10,220,169,132,118,2,83,99,78,205,216,211,154,240,236,143,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
