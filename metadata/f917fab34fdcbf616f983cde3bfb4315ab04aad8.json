It&amp;#039;s an independent, portable and free project, aiming at being compatible with AmigaOS 3.1 at the API level (like Wine, unlike UAE), while improving on it in many areas. The source code is available under an open source license, which allows anyone to freely improve upon it.\n\n[read more at http://aros.sourceforge.net/]\n\nMore words: Remember your old Amiga? ;)\n\n\nThen...\n\n\nVmwAROS is the AROS environment already installed and configured in a virtual machine. Compatible with any recent VMware product for Windows, Linux and Macintosh.\n\nThis is a LiveCD - VmwAROS Live! which can run on any PC hardware without virtualisation. It can be installed on the hard drive too.
