Seven of the nine cuts are blues covers (including three from John Lee Hooker and two from Robert Johnson), with one original and one stark Springsteen cover tossed in for good measure. The formula succeeds magically, thanks to Margo Timmins\\&amp;#039;s drowsy, pristine vocals, Michael Timmins\\&amp;#039;s gently snapping guitar, Alan Anton\\&amp;#039;s quietly rumbling bass, and Peter Timmins\\&amp;#039;s soft percussion palette. Whites not only serves as a perfect introduction to the doleful Junkie aesthetic, it somehow makes apathy sound compelling. --Marc Greilsamer  Amazon.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fde62771594fe48e049457bba79136f97d0e6b7","amp;dn":"Whites+Off+Earth+Now%21%21+-+Cowboy+Junkies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fde62771594fe48e049457bba79136f97d0e6b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,222,98,119,21,148,254,72,224,73,69,123,186,121,19,111,151,208,230,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
