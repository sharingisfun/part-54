Labels like Manchester's Factory, Glasgow's Postcard and London's Rough Trade and Mute evolved during this time and took the means of production back from the multinationals. We look at some of the key players from this period.\n\nProgramme 10: California Uber Alles\n\nWe look at how throughout the '80s and '90s, punk continued to influence music-making globally, but nowhere more so than America, through multi-million selling bands like Green Day and Offspring to the punk in contemporary acts from The Strokes to Limp Bizkit; The White Stripes to Blink 182.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Riot Of Your Own Episode Nine 2002 SVCD 25 minutes\nTypical Girls Episode Ten 2002 SVCD 25 minutes\n\nThese are in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players.
