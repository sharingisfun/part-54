HAPPY PILLS is an artistically schizophrenic record for Candlebox, who've previously been lumped squarely in the alt-rock category. The band moves from the Collective Soul-ish &quot;10,000 Horses&quot; to the thrashing Tool-style rhythms of the title tune to an almost Pearl Jam-esque power ballad (&quot;Blinders&quot;) without stopping to catch a breath. That's not to say there are no connecting elements here, the brash guitars and raw, rock-god vocals that are the band's trademark are present throughout. It just seems as though Candlebox are trying to play on a wider sonic field on HAPPY PILLS. Fans shouldn't fret though; ultimately the old adage applies: once a Candlebox always a Candlebox.\n\nCandlebox: Kevin Martin (vocals, guitar); Peter Klett (guitar); Bardi Martin (bass); Dave Krusen (drums, percussion).\n\nAdditional personnel: Kim Bullard (piano organ).\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a01273da02a09461d81872f3d17681d595577bf4","amp;dn":"Candlebox+-+Happy+Pills","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a01273da02a09461d81872f3d17681d595577bf4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,18,115,218,2,160,148,97,216,24,114,243,209,118,129,213,149,87,123,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
