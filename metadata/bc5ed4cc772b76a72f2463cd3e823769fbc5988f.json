[More]\nBased on the Elmore Leonard story, 3:10 TO YUMA is a\n riveting remake of the 1957 classic Western. It&amp;#039;s the\n story of Dan Evans (Christian Bale), a down-and-out\n rancher who lost his leg in the Civil War. With a wife\n and two sons, he is struggling to put food on the table,\n and unable to make payments on his land. When the notorious\n gunman Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) is apprehended nearby,\n a few local men are needed to escort him to the town of\n Contention so he can be put on the 3:10 train to Yuma \nPrison. Few will volunteer for the job, as they know that\n Wade&amp;#039;s ruthless gang will follow them, but Evans sees\n an opportunity to make some fast cash, and offers to\n go in exchange for $200. The small team of men set \noff, and are later joined by Evans&amp;#039;s young son William\n (Logan Lerman), who has run away from home to join them\n. What follows is a race against time, as the group tries\n to get to Yuma without the clever and dangerous Wade\n outsmarting them. Crowe is fantastic as the smooth-talking\n gunman, and Bale delivers a moving performance as the\n weary-eyed Evans. The two men are perfect foils for each\n other. Wade is the infamous gunman, living the high life\n on the wrong side of the law, while Evans, who has\n struggled to lead an honest life, has only faced one\n hardship after another. It is a classic tale of good vs\n. evil, right vs. wrong, and yet, by the story&amp;#039;s end,\n it becomes harder to separate the good guys from the bad.\n As the clock ticks down, the film builds to an emotional\n nail-biter of an ending, reminiscent of BUTCH CASSIDY \nAND THE SUNDANCE KID.
