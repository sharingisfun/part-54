It involves the return of notable Batman villain Ra&amp;#039;s al Ghul, and is his first appearance since his apparent death in Batman: Death and the Maidens in 2003. It also connects back to the Batman &amp; Son storyline, which introduced Damian as the son of Batman and Talia al Ghul. On May 7, 2008, DC Comics will reprint the eight issues crossover as 256-pages hardcover volume collecting the intense tale originally presented in Batman Annual #26, Batman #670-671, Robin #168-169, Robin ANNUAL #7, Nightwing #138-139, and Detective Comics #838-839!\n\nThe seeds for the story were planted in 2007&amp;#039;s Batman Annual #26, which added some more background to the origin story of Ra&amp;#039;s. The same week the first issue of the story came out, Robin Annual #7 served as a jumping off point with an interlude starring Damian.[/quote]\n\nBIG THANKS to all the scanners involved.\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE BOOK, THEN BUY THE COMICS OR THE TRADES.
