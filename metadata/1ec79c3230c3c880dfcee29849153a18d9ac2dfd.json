Already regarded as the most promising of the younger generation of English composers, he put his manuscript paper aside to serve his country in &quot;The Great War&quot;. How different things might have been if he had returned home alive to take his place among such names as Elgar, Vaughan Williams, Holst, and Britten?\n     The body of music that he did not destroy before setting off for France, notably the settings of poems from A Shropshire Lad by Housman, and various short orchestral works is, in a word, exquisite. In addition to his compositions, he is also remembered for his contributions to the turn-of-the-century revival of interest in English folk music and dance. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ec79c3230c3c880dfcee29849153a18d9ac2dfd","amp;dn":"George+Butterworth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ec79c3230c3c880dfcee29849153a18d9ac2dfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,199,156,50,48,195,200,128,223,206,226,152,73,21,58,24,217,172,45,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
