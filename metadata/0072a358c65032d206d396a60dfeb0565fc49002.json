The verses themselves, using the range and style of Sanskrit meter (chhandas) with similes and metaphors, are written in a poetic form that is traditionally chanted; hence the title, which translates to \\&quot;the Song of the Divine One\\&quot;. The Bhagavad Gita is revered as sacred by Hindu traditions, and especially so by Vaishnavas (followers of Vishnu). It is commonly referred to as The Gita.\n\nThe content of the text is a conversation between Krishna and Arjuna taking place on the battlefield of Kurukshetra just prior to the start of the Kurukshetra war. Responding to Arjuna\\&amp;#039;s confusion and moral dilemma, Krishna explains to Arjuna his duties as a warrior and Prince and elaborates on different Yogic and Vedantic philosophies, with examples and analogies. This has led to the Gita often being described as a concise guide to Hindu philosophy and also as a practical, self-contained guide to life. During the discourse, Krishna reveals his identity as the Supreme Being Himself (Svayam bhagavan), blessing Arjuna with an awe-inspiring glimpse of His divine universal form.\n\nThe Bhagavad Gita is also called Gitopanishad as well as Yogopanishad, implying its status as an Upanishad, or a Vedantic scripture. Since the Gita is drawn from the Mahabharata, it is a Smriti text. However, referring to it as an Upanishad is intended to give it status comparable to that of ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ruti, or revealed knowledge.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0072a358c65032d206d396a60dfeb0565fc49002","amp;dn":"Bhagavad+Gita+96kmps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0072a358c65032d206d396a60dfeb0565fc49002","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,114,163,88,198,80,50,210,6,211,150,166,13,254,176,86,95,196,144,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
