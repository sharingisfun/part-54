The twenty-six-year-old has \nabandoned the dangerous obligations pressed upon her by her father, and \nchosen instead to live a normal life. But Maya comes from a long line of \npeople who call themselves Harlequins?a fierce group of warriors willing to \nsacrifice their lives to protect a select few known as Travelers.\n\nGabriel and Michael Corrigan are brothers living in Los Angeles. Since \nchildhood, the young men have been shaped by stories that their late father \nwas a Traveler, one of a small band of prophets who have vastly influenced \nthe course of history. Travelers are able to attain pure enlightenment, and \nhave for centuries ushered change into the world. Gabriel and Michael, who \nmay have inherited their father&amp;#039;s gifts, have always protected themselves by \nliving &quot;off the Grid&quot;?that is, invisible to the real-life surveillance networks \nthat monitor people in our modern society.\n\nSummoned by her ailing father, Maya is told of the existence of the brothers. \nThe Corrigans are in severe danger, stalked by powerful men known as the \nTabula. As Maya races to California to protect the brothers, she is reluctantly \npulled back into the cold and solitary Harlequin existence. A colossal battle \nlooms?one that will reveal not only the identities of Gabriel and Michael \nCorrigan but also a secret history of our time.\n\n----\n\nJohn Twelve Hawks lives off the Grid.\n\n----\n\nActor and writed Scott Brick has performed on film, television, and radio. His \nstage appearances throughout the United States include Cyrano, Hamlet, \nand Macbeth.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8de083d6dfd4657315a2ad078cc3e6ad81f1cca1","amp;dn":"John+Twelve+Hawks+-+The+Traveler","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8de083d6dfd4657315a2ad078cc3e6ad81f1cca1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,224,131,214,223,212,101,115,21,162,173,7,140,195,230,173,129,241,204,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
