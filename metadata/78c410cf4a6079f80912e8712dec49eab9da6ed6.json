Currently XboxMediaCenter can be used to play/view most popular video/audio/picture formats such as MPEG-1/2/4, DivX, XviD, MP3, AAC, JPG, GIF plus many more less known formats directly from a CD/DVD in Xbox DVD-ROM drive or of the Xbox harddrive, XBMC can also play files from a PC over a local network and even stream media streams directly from the internet. XBMC has playlist and slideshow functions, a weather forecast and many audio visualizations. All these features enable the Xbox running XboxMediaCenter to fully function as a multimedia jukebox. XBMC is easy to use, it's convenient, flexible and offers great price/performance ratio. (This, The XboxMediaCenter Project is also known as 'Xbox Media Center' or simply 'XBMC'). Note! XBMC is a hobby project that is only developed by volunteers in their spare-time for free. (Remember that XboxMediaCenter does require a modded Xbox to run on or it will not function).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78c410cf4a6079f80912e8712dec49eab9da6ed6","amp;dn":"XBMC+Xbox+Media+Center+2004-09-17+%5BY%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78c410cf4a6079f80912e8712dec49eab9da6ed6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,196,16,207,74,96,121,248,9,18,232,113,45,236,73,234,185,218,110,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
