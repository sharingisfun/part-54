When rich Uncle Howard comes to town and agrees to help them out, he admits his finances are under investigation, and he asks them to do him a favor and \\&quot;take care of\\&quot; an old business relation to keep his trouble under wraps - he says that they\\&amp;#039;re family, and since he always takes care of them, the least they could do is help him out this once, as they\\&amp;#039;re the only ones he can trust. The film follows their struggle with the immorality of this request and how each brother chooses to deal with it.\n\n\nDivX, DVDRIP, 2CD\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3b2c1cac1cfd99d8338f76e0d1feec1761759bf","amp;dn":"Cassandras+Dream+%5B2007%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3b2c1cac1cfd99d8338f76e0d1feec1761759bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,178,193,202,193,207,217,157,131,56,247,110,13,31,238,193,118,23,89,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
