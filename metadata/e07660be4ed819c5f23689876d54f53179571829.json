Sidney Poitier gives one of his finest performances as Mark Thackeray, an out-of-work engineer who turns to teaching in Londons tough East End. The graduating class, led by Denham (Christian Roberts), Pamela (Judy Geeson) and Barbara (Lulu, who also sings the hit title song), sets out to destroy Thackeray as they did his predecessor by breaking his spirit. But Thackeray, no stranger to hostility, meets the challenge by treating the students as young adults who will soon enter a work force where they must stand or fall on their own. When offered an engineering job, Thackeray must decide if he wants to stay.\n\n\nOther features: Interactive Menus, Scene Access, Theatrical Trailer, Filmography\n\nDvd9 Untouched ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e07660be4ed819c5f23689876d54f53179571829","amp;dn":"TO+SIR%2C+WITH+LOVE+%281967%29++S.Potier+-Spa%2CEng%2CGer%2CFre%2CITa%2BMultisub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e07660be4ed819c5f23689876d54f53179571829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,118,96,190,78,216,25,197,242,54,137,135,109,84,245,49,121,87,24,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
