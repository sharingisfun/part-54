Today, a few line-up changes later, the band has evolved and is now influed by most kinds of metal. \n\t\t\tIn late 2005 a music video for the song &quot;Downward&quot; was recorded and released on DVD by the band members themselves. \n\t\t\tBeside the recordings a large amount of gigs has been performed over the years with bands like In Flames and Entombed\n\n\t\t\tRippers notes.\n\t\t\tThis release is approved by the band themselves, see it as a gift, and feel free to spread it as much as you want to.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t+SST+2008+\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t     \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dd569199aeba509a336318b46925a0ec3a08e55","amp;dn":"Spiritus_Sancti-Lead_Salvation-2006-SST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dd569199aeba509a336318b46925a0ec3a08e55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,213,105,25,154,235,165,9,163,54,49,139,70,146,90,14,195,160,142,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
