He&amp;#039;s a ska-punk kind of guy, so expect sounds like that of RX Bandits.\n\nI had joined this band, Tangerous, when it was under a different name, but I left due to personal musical conflicts. It&amp;#039;s not quite my cup of tea, but some of you might like it.\n\nTry it out, folks. If you don&amp;#039;t like it, junk it. If you do, they&amp;#039;re working on a full length album to be released this fall. Distribute to whomever you want.\n\n--Yzou","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb9c347d91a3e337a73cfad018a11740dacbf206","amp;dn":"Tangerous+-+DEMOlition%3A+Tangerous+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb9c347d91a3e337a73cfad018a11740dacbf206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,156,52,125,145,163,227,55,167,60,250,208,24,161,23,64,218,203,242,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
