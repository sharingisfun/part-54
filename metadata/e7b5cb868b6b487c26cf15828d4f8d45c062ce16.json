I&amp;#039;m Dan Madole, the vocalist/guitarist for a band called Sans Self. I&amp;#039;ve decided to release my music in a non-traditional way. The old methods are only good for distribution but screw the artists in so many ways that we can&amp;#039;t even count them. The new method, pioneered by artists like Radiohead and Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor, is to let the people have it for whatever they want to pay for it. That&amp;#039;s what I like to hear, so that&amp;#039;s what I&amp;#039;ll do. I recorded an album very hastily in 2003. It&amp;#039;s not of any sort of exceptional sound quality, but the songs are solid enough to pass muster. So I&amp;#039;m putting it out there for anyone who wants to hear it. Feel free to download, take a look at the digital CD booklet (read as: images), and let me know what you think. All the info is in the download. Thanks!\n\n-Dan Madole,\nSans Self","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7b5cb868b6b487c26cf15828d4f8d45c062ce16","amp;dn":"Sans+Self+-+Driven+%282003%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7b5cb868b6b487c26cf15828d4f8d45c062ce16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,181,203,134,139,107,72,124,38,207,21,130,141,79,141,69,192,98,206,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
