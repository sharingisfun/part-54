For years their CD was only available as a bootleg called &quot;Bloodied But Unbowed.&quot; As I understand it, the CD was done - professionally recorded and all, the artwork was all selected, and BANG! At the last second, the deal was pulled and the CD was never released until only very recently as &quot;Ace.&quot; The current version is actually missing some tracks, too. The version I have from 1996 goes:\n\n1. Hang &amp;#039;Em High\n2. Gone Bad\n3. The Maverick\n4. The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter\n5. Calling For You\n6. See You At Sunrise\n7. There&amp;#039;s No Angels Here\n8. Made For Trouble\n9. Ride Thru The Storm\n10. Son Of A Gun\n11. Emaheeval\n12. Easy Action\n13. Heart Of Saturday Night (Tom Waites cover)\n\nEncoded by LAME 3.97 (CBR 320kbit Joint stereo)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71e6a26dba8427dffd35eead7ff139aae7db27f2","amp;dn":"Desperado+-+1996+-+Bloodied%2CBut+Unbowed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71e6a26dba8427dffd35eead7ff139aae7db27f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,230,162,109,186,132,39,223,253,53,238,173,127,241,57,170,231,219,39,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
