Having said this, Juan Pablo is not a musician nor does he make his living off music. He works as an accountant. From Cipolletti, RÃƒÂ­o Negro (Patagonia Argentina), but now in Buenos Aires, Juan Pablo has dedicated almost a decade to recording demos and playing the guitar, bass and drums.\nIn the beginning, Cero Positivo was formed in 1999, during High School. At 16 y/o, Juan Pablo played the guitar and was lead singer, MatÃƒÂ­as Vidal played the bass and Carlos Arnao the drums. They hung out at Carlos&amp;#039;s house, for loud rehearsals, basically punk songs and some Nirvana covers, ?Chompi&amp;#039;s? (Juan Pablo&amp;#039;s nickname) favorite band.\nFor the following years, Chompi dedicated his time to studying other subjects, and music went on to be a precious hobby. During summer times, many demos were recorded at GastÃƒÂ³n Poirier&amp;#039;s house, the other &quot;soul&quot; of Cero Positivo.\nAll the tracks were composed, played and sung by Juan Pablo.\nSo here we are, eager to show all this material, from the early rehearsals to the project itself, that&amp;#039;s aimed to enclose the nicest tunes of Cero Positivo.\nOur proposal and recommendation: listen to the album ?Proyecto Cero Positivo? 2008 and, if you feel like it, there&amp;#039;s other 5 more albums, with their f*ck ups, but also hard work, so you can understand the evolution of the band.\nAll this you will find at www.proceropositivo.com.ar\n\nIt&amp;#039;s vital to us, helpers of Cero Positivo, that you leave an opinion about this album and, if you liked it, you spread the word (and links :D).\nWe say ?us? because although &quot;Cero Positivo&quot; is Juan Pablo Manzur, there&amp;#039;s lots of people who helped and keeps lending a hand for this to really work.\n\nIf you&amp;#039;re a musician, have a band, or your an underground fan, please leave us your contact info or website so you can also share with us your songs or ideas. The aid is mutual: Ã‚Â¡you listen to us, we listen to you!\nRock Stars, or know-it-alls, please give it a rest, this ain&amp;#039;t for ya.\n\nThanks so much for reading?
