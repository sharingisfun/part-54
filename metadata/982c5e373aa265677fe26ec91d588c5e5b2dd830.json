The record opens with lead single &quot;Devour.&quot; Its heavy onslaught of ripping guitars and relentless drums would not sound out of place on a Guitar Hero soundtrack. Of the album, frontman Brent Smith says &quot;In the seven years of this thing called Shinedown, IÃƒÂ¢??ve seen a lot of different things - what weÃƒÂ¢??ve all gone through on the road, things in our personal lives or witnessed firsthand through the fans that weÃƒÂ¢??ve made and the relationships weÃƒÂ¢??ve built with our audience. I think the biggest thing was I didnÃƒÂ¢??t want to sugarcoat the way life can be sometimes.&quot; Their face-melting rock comes as no surprise, considering that the band hails from sultry Jacksonville, Florida. Their 2003 debut album, Leave A Whisper, and sophomore follow-up, Us And Them, have been RIAA-certified platinum and gold respectively and they have had songs featured on the WWE, ESPN and in various video games. Shinedown will be out on the road this spring and summer, playing a handful of radio shows and outdoor festivals including Rock On The Range before setting out on their own headlining tour.\n\n\n\n**Released 06/17/08 exclusively on their Myspace page as noted in their blog:\n\n&lt;i&gt;&quot; Tuesday, June 17, 2008\n  \t\n\nThe Sound of Madness MySpace Premier\n\nCheck out the exclusive premier of our album The Sound of Madness on our profile RIGHT NOW.
