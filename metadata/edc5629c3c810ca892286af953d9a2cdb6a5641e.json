The new jack swing was at its peak and this movie sums it up. It became a break-through for then young actors Martin Lawrence and Tisha Campbell. This reminds me of the time when I was a teenager who wanted to sneak out to go to a party and later got caught. I was in the 10th grade when this movie was released and I had a lot of fun during that time with not too much fighting at parties. The bullies played by the R&amp;B group Full Force made the movie more funny with its slapstick humor and the memorable Robin Harris with his witty punchlines. It&amp;#039;s sad to see him leave this earth at an early age,and comedian Bernie Mac reminds me of him. I remember he died the weekend of this movie and this was a shock. He could have been one of the funniest comedians in the 90s but his life was put to a halt and made way for several comedians who are now today&amp;#039;s superstars (namely from Def Comedy Jam). House Party also remind me of how fun hip-hop was,and back then hip-hop was political,educational,radical,and uplifting. This movie can go down in history as how African-Americans can enjoy themselves with no use of drugs and unprotected sex. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edc5629c3c810ca892286af953d9a2cdb6a5641e","amp;dn":"House.Party.DVDRiP+KvCD-TUS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edc5629c3c810ca892286af953d9a2cdb6a5641e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,197,98,156,60,129,12,168,146,40,106,249,83,217,162,205,182,165,100,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
