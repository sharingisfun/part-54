It took me 3 days to download this off an obscure spanish torrent, because the 560meg &amp;#039;rip&amp;#039; of the game is of AIDS and FAIL.  Seriously.\n\nI digress:\n\n\nThis is a little known, or very low-press game that was released in 2006 by a German company that got little to know press here in the US and most of the rest of the world.  The game features lush environments, good physics, a exceedingly easy &amp;#039;cheat&amp;#039; system, and modification in game with the console commands.  It has a rudimentary &amp;#039;level up&amp;#039; system, and tons of other neat features, including a &amp;#039;how good to you kill&amp;#039; system, for better points for upgrades.  \n\nThe story, simple.  It&amp;#039;s based off the Island of Dr. Moreau in which you are a grunt soldier assigned to an &amp;#039;island&amp;#039; of beast.  Upon landing you find out that you are being dupped, very soon, and something fishy is up.\n\nThe game is dated, but, with any &amp;#039;modern&amp;#039; gaming rig you should have NO problems running it.  It runs exceedingly well on my Radeon 1950 256meg card, FSAA 16x and Ansistropic 6x.  With 80fps or better, so yeah, it looks damn good.  \n\nI won&amp;#039;t bore you with a big zOMG ASCI graphic, I&amp;#039;m too lazy.  However, here are the instructions if you&amp;#039;ve been looking for this, or know someone who is:\n\n1. First off, download, imagine that.\n\n2. Mount the ISO with Daemon Tools (I included the copy I use), as well, it works for me, so go figure.\n\n3. Unzip &amp;#039;1.Vivi_DEU_Uncut_11.zip&amp;#039; To the \\Vivisector diretory, and &amp;#039;replace&amp;#039; the files it asks for.\n\n4: Install &amp;#039;2.VivisectorGoreFinal.exe&amp;#039; It&amp;#039;s German, so yeah, fuck with it, you&amp;#039;ll get it if you&amp;#039;ve installed ANY other damn program before.\n\n5: Extract &amp;#039;3.VV2.rar&amp;#039; to the \\Vivisector directory, replace. \n\nThats it.  Yes, I know, BAWWW lots of shit, but hey, I made this as SIMPLE as possible.  And, it works, except for one movie around a &amp;#039;way point&amp;#039; in the first stay, near the gates.  So, yeah, keep that &amp;#039;quick save&amp;#039; handy, but otherwise, I&amp;#039;m on stage 4 no problems.\n\nWhat These PATCHES do is fix it so it&amp;#039;s updated to 1.1, MASSIVE sound fix.  And some small ones.  Adds a fuck load of gore, seriously, gibs, body parts, destroyable flesh, etc.  And, ENGLISH MOTHERFUCKER DO YOU SPEAK IT... The game&amp;#039;s spoken dialogue is in English, but oddly, its text is in German. o.o  So, yeah, the last patch turns them all to English so you can read them.  \n\nAnd, please, don&amp;#039;t be douchbags and post HOW DO I INSTALL or something equally retarded.  If you&amp;#039;re here, and don&amp;#039;t know how to uncompress a .rar multi-part, go here, http://img.4chan.org/b/imgboard.html and ask for help, they&amp;#039;ll be glad to so so.\n\nI&amp;#039;m also on a 100k upload DSL, so, it&amp;#039;s going to take a while to seed, so be patient, if you&amp;#039;re trying for it.  I&amp;#039;ll keep it going all weekend till Monday, April 1st, fitting, around midnight.  We&amp;#039;ll see how many copies get out there, so take care, enjoy it if you get it, if not, Ill try later to upload it again.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9888231292d53b759ca09ea7efaa658affccd6d","amp;dn":"Vivisector+%3A+The+Beast+Within+%28Full+Game%29+%28Patches%2C+The+Works%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9888231292d53b759ca09ea7efaa658affccd6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,136,130,49,41,45,83,183,89,202,9,234,126,250,166,88,175,252,205,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
