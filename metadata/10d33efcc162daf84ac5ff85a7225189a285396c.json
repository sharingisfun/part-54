It sounds more like the band Santana in the beginning, than anything Carlos Santana has done lately. \nGregg Rollie is one of the most underappreciated men in rock. He left the best incarnation of Santana to form Journey with Neal Schon, and eventually left to form Storm and do some great solo stuff. \nRoots is no Abraxas - but it&amp;#039;s close.\n\nCover arts included.\n\nEnjoy, please comment and seed! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:10d33efcc162daf84ac5ff85a7225189a285396c","amp;dn":"Latin+rock+-+Gregg+Rolie+of+Santana+-+Roots+-+2001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"10d33efcc162daf84ac5ff85a7225189a285396c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,211,62,252,193,98,218,248,74,197,255,133,167,34,81,137,162,133,57,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
