Deep in an Antarctic base, the FLIPback team is frantically devising a system to reverse the change in polarity. Above them, the SS Elysium carries its jet-set passengers on the ultimate cruise. On board is Ruby Duvall, a journalist sent to record the FLIPback moment. Instead she finds a man called the Doctor, who is locked out of the strange green box he says is part of his time machine, and old enemies of the Doctor; silver giants at work beneath the earth.\n\n56k\nChapters\n\nI think it was [B]HandyAndy[/B] who uploaded this to Demonoid although I could be wrong","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e68b2ca3168a7f44de5b0641495522ff859bc80e","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+Iceberg+RNIB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e68b2ca3168a7f44de5b0641495522ff859bc80e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,139,44,163,22,138,127,68,222,91,6,65,73,85,34,255,133,155,200,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
