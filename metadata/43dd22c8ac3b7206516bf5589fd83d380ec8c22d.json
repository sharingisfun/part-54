Some AVs complain with it recognizing RunHiddenConsole.exe as a malicious/potentially harmful program as it can be used to hide malicious behaviours. If it&amp;#039;s your case, or just don&amp;#039;t trust in the first one, use the second version that runs the batch file directly, you will have the sloppy DOS window in the background but less complaints from antiviruses.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed.... :o)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43dd22c8ac3b7206516bf5589fd83d380ec8c22d","amp;dn":"ProductKeyExplorer+v2.0.7+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43dd22c8ac3b7206516bf5589fd83d380ec8c22d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,221,34,200,172,59,114,6,81,107,245,88,159,216,61,56,14,200,194,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
