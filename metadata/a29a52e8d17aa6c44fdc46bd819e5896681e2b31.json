Needless to say the camera work is 100x better than previous episodes but as this was not from Daryl&amp;#039;s house and has no special guest (nor a debut song) it seems a bit &quot;off topic&quot; for the series to date.\n\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a29a52e8d17aa6c44fdc46bd819e5896681e2b31","amp;dn":"Daryl+Hall+-Live+from+Daryl%5C%27s+House+Part+6.WebRip.%5BPSoul%5D.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a29a52e8d17aa6c44fdc46bd819e5896681e2b31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,154,82,232,209,122,166,196,79,220,70,189,129,158,88,150,104,30,43,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
