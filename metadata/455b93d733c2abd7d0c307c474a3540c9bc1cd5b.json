They released four albums on their own label Tess Records from 1989 to 1999 to major acclaim and growing popularity.\n\nThis Ascension toured the United States three times and the west coast prolifically, sharing the stage with bands including Clan of Xymox, The Jesus and Mary Chain, Chris Isaak, The Wolfgang Press and Pixies.\n\nAfter Tess Records collapsed, the band signed to Projekt Records in 2001. Their back catalogue was rereleased, however plans to record new material were never successful and the band split soon afterwards. The group reformed for a few shows in 2004.\n\nVocalist Dru has gone on to sing for the neo-classical project Mirabilis as well as ethereal/electronic act Falling You. Bassist Charlie has rejoined his former band Nerf Herder and guitarist Kevin Serra runs the music review site Kevchino.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:455b93d733c2abd7d0c307c474a3540c9bc1cd5b","amp;dn":"This+Ascension+-+three+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"455b93d733c2abd7d0c307c474a3540c9bc1cd5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,91,147,215,51,194,171,215,208,195,7,196,116,163,84,12,155,193,205,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
