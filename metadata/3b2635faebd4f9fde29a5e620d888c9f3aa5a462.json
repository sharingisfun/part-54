Formed the previous year by Per GyllenbÃƒÂ¤ck (vocals), Johan Axelsson (guitar), Jean-Paul Asenov (bass) and Rikard WermÃƒÂ©n (drums), the band was hampered by countless line-up changes and general indifference throughout the 1990&amp;#039;s, but they&amp;#039;ve soldiered on regardless with a number of independent releases under their belts. These include the Architects of Perversion and Sculpture of the Dead E.P.s (both 1994), and albums such as Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ96&amp;#039;s Rated-X, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ98&amp;#039;s High on Blood and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ99&amp;#039;s III, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ01&amp;#039;s Deranged and Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ02&amp;#039;s Plainfield Cemetery. ~ Ed Rivadavia, All Music Guide\n\nORIGIN  HjÃƒÂ¤rup, SkÃƒÂ¥ne LÃƒÂ¤n, Sweden \nSTATUS  Active \nFORMED IN  1991 \nLABEL  Listenable Records \n \nRikard WermÃƒÂ©n 1991- Drums See also Murder Corporation \nMagnus Gille 2002- Bass  \nJohan Axelsson 1991- Guitars See also Murder Corporation \nKalle FÃƒÂ¤lt 2002- Vocals \n\n1993 ...The Confessions Continues Obliteration Records \n1993 Architects Of Perversions Repulse \n1994 Upon The Medical Slab MMI \n1994 Sculpture Of The Dead Repulse \n1995 Rated-X Repulse \n1997 High On Blood Regain Records \n2000 III Listenable Records \n2001 Deranged Listenable Records \n2001 [split 10&quot; w/ Abscess] Listenable Records \n2002 Plainfield Cemetary\n\nAlbums ripped in various bitrates.\nSorry no covers for this one  :beer00: \n\nThe pack includes the albums mentioned above + some goodies  :rolleyes: \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b2635faebd4f9fde29a5e620d888c9f3aa5a462","amp;dn":"Deranged+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b2635faebd4f9fde29a5e620d888c9f3aa5a462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,38,53,250,235,212,249,253,226,154,94,98,13,136,140,159,58,165,164,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
