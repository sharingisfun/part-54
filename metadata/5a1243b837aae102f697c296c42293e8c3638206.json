Most of the best of these have been gathered together in an excellent series (on CD as well). Care to hear John Lennon singing &quot;Honey Don&amp;#039;t&quot;? Fantastic live performances of &quot;Some Other Guy&quot; and &quot;Thank You Girl&quot;? Unreleased gems like &quot;Soldier Of Love&quot;, &quot;Youngblood&quot; and &quot;Lucille&quot;? This is the place. Be warned, however, that these are vintage mono radio broadcasts, and include between song chatter and an announcer. \n\n9-CD set from Great Dane in Italy, covering every known-to-exist appearance of the Beatles at the Beeb in CDRom format. This is a virtual &quot;Web Site&quot; on disc.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a1243b837aae102f697c296c42293e8c3638206","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+At+The+Beeb+complete+Great+Dane+collection+CDRom","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a1243b837aae102f697c296c42293e8c3638206","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,18,67,184,55,170,225,2,246,151,194,150,196,34,147,232,195,99,130,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
