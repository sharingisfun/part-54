From the opening bass thuds to the final notes, there's nothing on the album that could be considered a misstep. The playing is incredibly skilled, with the Wright brothers effortlessly shifting tempos and time signatures and Kerr's razor sharp lyrics clicking right into place. Throughout, the album is fused with a sense of energy that was missing from Small Parts Isolated and Destroyed. Best of all is the silly &amp;quot;Rags and Bones&amp;quot; with Kerr (referred to on this release as &amp;quot;none of your f*cking business&amp;quot;) claiming that he is &amp;quot;married to a cigarette butt lying in the gutter&amp;quot; over some of the most complex instrumentation you're ever likely to find in good ol' punk rawk. Although they still had a number of albums in them, Nomeansno would never top this one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddff3b7ee3708d3fe882460cf6473396f32304fe","amp;dn":"Nomeansno+-+Wrong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddff3b7ee3708d3fe882460cf6473396f32304fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,255,59,126,227,112,141,63,232,130,70,12,246,71,51,150,243,35,4,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
