Matt Dillon plays a handsome thirty-something Joe who seems to have it all--a lovely blond fiancee (MARRIED WITH CHILDREN's Christina Applegate) and a high paying job at a bank. In one morning however, he is dually dumped--by both his girlfriend and his boss. \n\nNote: this is not a romantic comedy, but a slightly darker sort of tale, yet entertaining. The feeling of this film reminded me of a favourite of mine: &quot;Kill me later&quot;. I edited the description above as it was part faulty, part spoiler.\n \nCredits \nCast: Christina Applegate, Dave Foley, Matt Dillon, Steve Zahn \n\n \n&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362590&quot;&gt;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0362590&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26ae75befddae82f956a34470b50d73f0d36fa36","amp;dn":"Employee+Of+The+Month+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26ae75befddae82f956a34470b50d73f0d36fa36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,174,117,190,253,218,232,47,149,106,52,71,11,80,215,63,13,54,250,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
