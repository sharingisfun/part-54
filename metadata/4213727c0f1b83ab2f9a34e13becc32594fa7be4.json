I am not sure if this  ?Double Length? is caused by the complexity of the work or simply a bit of laziness. But I declare ?celebrating the 50th? as the official reason for this.\n\nThe log files of my blog show from where clicks are coming in. One of the most successful linkers is Jeff (jeffegg2) on flickr. He drops a comment with a link to this site whenever appropriate.\n\nThere is a GIMP users group on flickr that I found out about on this way. And there I found a tutorial from Shelly and Roy about making a comic like drawing out of a photography.\n\nI was looking for such an effect for a while. My final goal is to do something like Roy Lichtenstein did - replacing every colour gradient with solid colour or a dot pattern. I think this is a step on that way.\n\nI am not very happy with my result. It still has too much ?non-comic? in it. If you compare my work with this image from Shelly and Roy, you see that I am not really there. ;-)\n\nOne thing that I found out after I made the video: these images are very ugly to scale down. So work in your final resolution.\n\nYou can find the file used in this episode at the usual place.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4213727c0f1b83ab2f9a34e13becc32594fa7be4","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_050_Comic","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4213727c0f1b83ab2f9a34e13becc32594fa7be4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,19,114,124,15,27,131,171,47,154,52,225,59,236,195,37,148,250,123,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
