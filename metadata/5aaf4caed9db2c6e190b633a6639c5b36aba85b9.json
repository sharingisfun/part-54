In the post-grunge era, when \\&quot;alternative\\&quot; became a byword for sincere, hard-hitting music with a thunderous guitar attack, Live dominated the charts by blending alt-rock muscle with the brainy, melodic sensibility of bands like R.E.M. and U2. AWAKE represents the band\\'s best moments and, since it gives equal shrift to each of their six albums, serves as an economical career retrospective as well.\n\n\\&quot;Operation Spirit (The Tyranny of Tradition)\\&quot; and \\&quot;Pain Lies on the Riverside,\\&quot; from Live\\'s first album, MENTAL JEWELRY, kick off the set. Both are swirling, tense rock songs driven by a popping, near-funk bass line. THROWING COPPER, the group\\'s sophomore effort, is represented here by the mega-hits \\&quot;Selling the Drama\\&quot; (a contemplative rocker), the churning \\&quot;I Alone,\\&quot; and the forbidding ballad \\&quot;Lightning Crashes.\\&quot; Though Live\\'s later records didn\\'t match the commercial success of their first two, the orchestral drama of \\&quot;Overcome,\\&quot; the furious \\&quot;Lakini\\'s Juice,\\&quot; and even a moody cover of Johnny Cash\\'s \\&quot;I Walk the Line\\&quot; prove that the music didn\\'t diminish in quality, even as Live passed out of the mainstream spotlight. A winning collection, AWAKE testifies to Live\\'s conviction and power.\n\nLiner Note Author: Ed Kowalczyk.\n\nRecording information: 1991 - 2003.\n\nLive: Ed Kowalczyk (vocals); Patrick Dahlheimer, Chad Gracey, Chad Taylor.\n\nAdditional personnel: Shelby Lynne (vocals); Jerry Harrison, Michael Railton (keyboards).\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aaf4caed9db2c6e190b633a6639c5b36aba85b9","amp;dn":"Live+-+Awake+%28the+Best+of%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aaf4caed9db2c6e190b633a6639c5b36aba85b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,175,76,174,217,219,44,110,25,11,99,58,102,57,197,179,106,186,133,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
