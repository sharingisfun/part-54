The film was directed by Michael Curtiz and stars Humphrey Bogart as Rick Blaine and Ingrid Bergman as Ilsa Lund. It focuses on Rick&amp;#039;s conflict between, in the words of one character, love and virtue: he must choose between his love for Ilsa and doing the right thing, helping her and her Resistance leader husband escape from Casablanca to continue his fight against the Nazis.\n\nAlthough it was an A-list movie, with established stars and first-rate writers, nobody involved with its production expected Casablanca to be anything out of the ordinary;[1] it was just one of dozens of pictures being churned out by Hollywood every year. The film was a solid, if unspectacular, success in its initial release, but has grown in popularity as time has gone by, consistently ranking near the top of lists of great films. Casablanca is now ranked among the greatest cinematic achievements of all time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:069a91149806b900581982bf3d372db3c2565546","amp;dn":"Casablanca.%28DVDRip.DivX.Rus%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"069a91149806b900581982bf3d372db3c2565546","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,154,145,20,152,6,185,0,88,25,130,191,61,55,45,179,194,86,85,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
