Puppy mills, which keep large quantities of purebred dogs in overcrowded, often shockingly inhumane conditions, are a well-kept secret of the pet-trade industry, and the animal protection community is extremely grateful to Oprah for exposing this major cause of pet overpopulation to a wide audience.\n\nItÃƒÂ¢??s standard practice for puppy millsÃƒÂ¢??which supply animals to pet stores and purebred enthusiasts, without any concern for the millions who will die in shelters as a resultÃƒÂ¢??to keep animals in constant confinement, without proper veterinary care or socialization. ItÃƒÂ¢??s common to hear stories of puppy mills that are shut down on cruelty to animals charges (I posted about one a couple of weeks ago), but itÃƒÂ¢??s nowhere near common enoughÃƒÂ¢??and these sordid operations will continue to thrive for as long as people support them by purchasing animals from pet stores or seeking out purebred animals from breeders.
