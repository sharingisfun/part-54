We would like to thank the thousands of people, from all backgrounds and religions, who gave us their support. They realised LiveLeak.com is a vehicle for many opinions and not just for the support of one.\n\nPerhaps there is still hope that this situation may produce a discussion that could benefit and educate all of us as to how we can accept one anothers culture.\n\nWe stood for what we believe in, the ability to be heard, but in the end the price was too high.&quot; \n\n29/03/2008 Liveleak.com\n\n- Guess this is where the power of P2P is going to show its worth! \nPlease help distribute this collection of high-quality counter-jihad documentaries which are all to some extend being ignored, banned or condemned by broadcasters in europe and abroad.
