TERRORSTORM reveals how, in the last hundred years, Western leaders have repeatedly murdered their own citizens while posing as their saviors.\n\nIn TERRORSTORM you will discover that September 11th, the attacks of 7/7 in London, and many other terrorist events were self-inflicted wounds. You will witness British Special Forces troops caught in the act of staging terror attacks in Iraq and see official US government documents laying out plans to hijack passenger planes by remote control. You will learn how the Reichstag fire, the Gulf of Tonkin, and the US-backed Iranian coup of 1953 are all interconnected false-flag terror events.\n\t\nThis powerful documentary explores the mindset of the average brainwashed Westerner. It delves deeply in to the systems of control which have been scientifically-crafted to imprison their minds and keep their eyes closed to the realities of the world around them. \n\n\nGeneral #0\nFormat                       : MPEG-4\nFile size                    : 571 MiB\nPlayTime                     : 2h 9mn\nMovie name                   : Terrorstorm\nPerformer                    : Alex Jones\nWriting application          : HandBrake 0.9.2 2008022300\n\nVideo #0\nCodec                        : AVC\nCodec/Info                   : H.264 (3GPP)\nPlayTime                     : 2h 9mn\nBit rate                     : 500 Kbps\nWidth                        : 640 pixels\nHeight                       : 480 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio         : 4/3\nFrame rate                   : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate           : 29.963 fps\nMaximum frame rate           : 29.981 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)           : 0.054\nStreamSize                   : 464 MiB\n\nAudio #0\nCodec/Info                   : AAC Low Complexity\nPlayTime                     : 2h 9mn\nBit rate mode                : VBR\nBit rate                     : 111 Kbps\nChannel(s)                   : 2 channels\nChannel positions            : L R\nSampling rate                : 48 KHz\nResolution                   : 16 bits\nStreamSize                   : 103 MiB\n\n\n-----Endgame-----\n\nJones chronicles the history of the global elite's bloody rise to power and reveals how they have funded dictators and financed the bloodiest warsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢??creating order out of chaos to pave the way for the first true world empire.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Watch as Jones and his team track the elusive Bilderberg Group to Ottawa and Istanbul to document their secret summits, allowing you to witness global kingpins setting the world's agenda and instigating World War III.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Learn about the formation of the North America transportation control grid, which will end U.S. sovereignty forever.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Discover how the practitioners of the pseudo-science eugenics have taken control of governments worldwide as a means to carry out depopulation.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ View the progress of the coming collapse of the United States and the formation of the North American Union.\n\nFormat                       : MPEG-4\nFile size                    : 700 MiB\nPlayTime                     : 2h 19mn\nBit rate                     : 701 Kbps\nStreamSize                   : 4.06 MiB\nMovie name                   : Endgame\nPerformer                    : Alex Jones\nWriting application          : HandBrake 0.9.2 2008022300\n\nVideo #0\nCodec/Family                 : AVC\nCodec/Info                   : H.264 (3GPP)\nPlayTime                     : 2h 19mn\nBit rate                     : 570 Kbps\nWidth                        : 640 pixels\nHeight                       : 368 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio         : 16/9\nFrame rate                   : 29.970 fps\nMinimum frame rate           : 29.963 fps\nMaximum frame rate           : 29.981 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)           : 0.081\nStreamSize                   : 569 MiB\n\nAudio #0\nCodec                        : AAC LC\nCodec/Info                   : AAC Low Complexity\nPlayTime                     : 2h 19mn\nBit rate mode                : VBR\nBit rate                     : 127 Kbps\nChannel(s)                   : 2 channels\nChannel positions            : L R\nSampling rate                : 48 KHz\nResolution                   : 16 bits\nStreamSize                   : 127 MiB\n\n\n-----911: The Road to Tyranny-----\nTHE GOVERNMENT NEEDED A CRISIS TO CONVINCE THE PEOPLE TO WILLINGLY GIVE UP THEIR LIBERTY IN EXCHANGE FOR SAFETY.
