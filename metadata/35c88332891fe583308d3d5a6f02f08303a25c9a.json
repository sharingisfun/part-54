The original lineup of James Alexander (bass), Jimmy King (guitar), Ronnie Caldwell (organ), Phalon Jones (sax), Carl Cunningham (drums), and Ben Cauley (trumpet) were only together long enough to have issued this album prior to the tragic loss of everyone sans Alexander and Cauley in the December '67 plane crash that also claimed the life of Otis Redding. - from AMG.\n\nenjoy and seed :]\n\n/owl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35c88332891fe583308d3d5a6f02f08303a25c9a","amp;dn":"Bar-Kays+-+Soul+Finger+%281967%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35c88332891fe583308d3d5a6f02f08303a25c9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,200,131,50,137,31,229,131,48,141,61,90,111,2,240,131,3,162,92,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
