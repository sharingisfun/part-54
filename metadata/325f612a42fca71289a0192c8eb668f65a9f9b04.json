I didn't include it in the DVD because it has its own autorun, installer and menus, and my aim was simply to produce a single disc from which to install the full suite. I'm told that the content of CD7 can be downloaded from Adobe Public servers (though I can't find it!!) but cannot be run if burned to CD!\n\nEnjoy!!!\n\nPeter","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:325f612a42fca71289a0192c8eb668f65a9f9b04","amp;dn":"Total+Training+for+Adobe+Creative+Suite+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"325f612a42fca71289a0192c8eb668f65a9f9b04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,95,97,42,66,252,167,18,137,160,25,44,142,182,104,246,90,159,155,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
