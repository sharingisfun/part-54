About the commentary , Uwe doesent talk all the time , he shuts up pretty often because of his bad english accent , the original english audio track is audible all the time troughout the movie it just gets leveled down when he talks , so basically if you dont want to get subtitles or sumthing you can watch the movie with commentary and mostly get the english track so you get most of the jokes and can follow the main story line.\n\n\nEnjoy\n\n\nLGLuX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7ce4d04dbbeee2e638d906d0d5c8de9d6441c6b","amp;dn":"Postal.DVDRip.Ger-LGLuX.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7ce4d04dbbeee2e638d906d0d5c8de9d6441c6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,206,77,4,219,190,238,46,99,141,144,109,13,92,141,233,214,68,28,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
