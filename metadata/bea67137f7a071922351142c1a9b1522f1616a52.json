Express Lab\nThis all-new, super-fast photo fixing mode is amazing! You&amp;#039;ll save hours of time with the Express Lab, because now you can edit dozens of photos in the time it used to take to edit just a few! Just think how easy it will be to breeze through folders full of photos ??? cropping, rotating, removing red eye, and straightening, ??? without having to wait for each individual photo to open.\n\nThat&amp;#039;s only a small taste of the photo fixing you can do in the NEW Express Lab. We can tell you how it helps you fly through viewing and fixing your photos, but to truly understand the power of the NEW Express Lab you have to experience it for yourself.\n\nNEW! Graphite Workspace Theme\nNot only is Paint Shop Pro Photo X2 packed with all-new features, it looks different too. As soon as you launch the program, you&amp;#039;ll see the NEW Graphite Workspace Theme. This darker theme really makes your photos stand out! And for people who don&amp;#039;t like change, you can switch back to the classic interface with just a few clicks.\n\nHDR Photo Merge\nWith NEW HDR Photo Merge you can easily create photos that give you full detail in the shadows and the highlights of your photos. HDR Photo Merge helps you combine two or more photos taken at different exposures, and then automatically dodge and burn to bring out the contrast!\n\nNEW! Layer Styles\nWith the NEW Layer Styles you can easily add drop shadows, embossing, outer and inner glows, bevels and even reflections to your text, photos and creative projects. The best part of these new Layer Styles is if you make any changes to the layer the effect is automatically changed to match.\n\nVisible Watermarks\nWhether you&amp;#039;re a professional photographer or someone who wants to share your photos online, it&amp;#039;s a good idea to add a discrete watermark that reminds those viewing your pictures who the photographer was. With the NEW Visible Watermarks feature you can easily create and add a personal watermark to all your photos.\n\nNEW! Picture Tubes??ÃƒÂ³ &amp; Picture Frames\nPaint Shop Pro Photo X2 includes over 30 brand-new, professionally-designed Picture Tubes??ÃƒÂ³ and 30 new Picture Frames! Plus for people who upgrade to Paint Shop Pro Photo X2, there&amp;#039;s an exclusive set of all-new, never seen before Picture Tubes and Picture Frames just for you!\n\nIMPROVED! Black &amp; White Film Conversion\nThis feature lets you create dynamic black &amp; white photos by simulating the effects of shooting black &amp; white film with colored filters.\n\nNow you can select from a virtually infinite range of color combinations where before you could chose from pre-chosen color filters. This gives you the full creative control of the Channel Mixer command, but in a far simpler interface. Plus you can adjust brightness and apply Clarify to further enhance the black &amp; white effect.\n\nNEW &amp; IMPROVED! Makeover Tools\nPaint Shop Pro Photo&amp;#039;s Makeover Tools give you a set of professional retouching tools that are easy to use. This year we&amp;#039;ve added two new features to your toolbox: NEW Thinify??ÃƒÂ³, which makes the people in your photos look thinner with just a click, and New Eye Drops that takes the red out of bloodshot eyes. In addition, improvements have also been made to the Blemish Remover and the Suntan Brush.\n\nNEW! Crop to New Image\nFor people who scan a lot of images, especially multiple images at once, New Crop As New Image will save you time! Now you can click Crop As New Image, and the cropped portion of your scan is automatically opened in a new document. All you need to do is save it!\n\n(for more detail go to www.corel.com)\n\nPLEASE!!! DO NOT STOP SEEDING AFTER DOWNLOADING.
