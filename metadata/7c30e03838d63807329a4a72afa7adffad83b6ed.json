Flight Engineer Willets explains that when &quot;Angel Babe&quot; leads they always come home safe. On the ground Major Stovall waits with a team from the Public Relations Office (PRO) who are filming &amp; photographing the plane which has completed its 49th mission. They want to take the plane back to the US for a promotional tour as it will be the first in the Eight AF to complete 50 missions. The Flight Engineer, Technical Sergeant Willets thinks that &quot;Angel Babe&quot; is a fighter and she won&amp;#039;t want to go home this way and it certainly seems that she doesn&amp;#039;t.\n\nGuest star: Tom Stern (Lt.
