Wagstaffe\nOriginal Music: Dru Masters\nCast: Dave Gorman ~ Himself\n      Stef Wagstaffe ~ Herself\n      Andy Devonshire ~ Himself\nStudio/Producer: Avalon Television\n\nDave Gorman sets off on a journey to see if it&amp;#039;s still possible to live in America without giving any money to &amp;#039;The Man&amp;#039;. Travelling coast-to-coast, he&amp;#039;s not staying in any chain hotels, eating in any chain restaurants, or filling up at any chain gas stations. On this journey, only independent &quot;Mom &amp; Pop&quot; businesses will do. Of course, travelling unchained in a chained world is tricky--when you&amp;#039;re tired you can&amp;#039;t just stop at a Starbucks, and when the tank is running empty you can&amp;#039;t just pull up at the next gas station. Staying true to the task was always going to be a struggle, but the people facing the real struggle are those working to keep the unchained businesses of America alive.\n\nNotes;\n\nEncoded in DivX 5\n\nFile/Movie info based on aXXo&amp;#039;s release NFO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4cec6e32b565da6a6ab69c5ed73476177caef83","amp;dn":"Dave.Gorman.In.America.Unchained%5B2008%5DDvDrip%5BEng%5D-Zoenn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4cec6e32b565da6a6ab69c5ed73476177caef83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,206,198,227,43,86,93,166,166,171,105,197,237,115,71,97,119,202,239,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
