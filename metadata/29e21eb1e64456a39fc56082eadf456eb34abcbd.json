The game features cartoon-themed graphics and physics, and relies heavily on classic shooter weaponry and gameplay. The controls are heavily inspired by the FPS genre of computer games. The latest release is 0.4.2. With version 0.4.0 the game changed name from Teewars to Teeworlds, the developers citing inspecific legal reasons[1].\n\nTeeworlds is still under development, but it is playable and can be downloaded free of charge at the Teeworlds home page. Versions for Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X are currently available. In December 2007, the source code was made available to the public, enabling enthusiasts to port it to run on other platforms such as *BSD. It is reported to run well under Wine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29e21eb1e64456a39fc56082eadf456eb34abcbd","amp;dn":"Teeworlds+-+Multiplayer+Shooting+Game+-+%5C%22little+buggers+w","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29e21eb1e64456a39fc56082eadf456eb34abcbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,226,30,177,230,68,86,163,159,197,96,130,234,223,69,110,179,74,188,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
