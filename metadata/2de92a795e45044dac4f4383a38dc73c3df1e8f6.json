He made his big break in Sweden in the year 2000 with the song &quot;KÃƒÂ¤nn ingen sorg fÃƒÂ¶r mig GÃƒÂ¶teborg&quot; (&quot;Don&amp;#039;t feel bad for me, Gothenburg&quot;). In 2005, HellstrÃƒÂ¶m released his fourth album, NÃƒÂ¥t gammalt, nÃƒÂ¥t nytt, nÃƒÂ¥t lÃƒÂ¥nat, nÃƒÂ¥t blÃƒÂ¥tt (literally: Somethin&amp;#039; old, somethin&amp;#039; new, somethin&amp;#039; borrowed, somethin&amp;#039; blue), which is a collection of old material that never made it onto any of his albums, a few new songs and cover. In 2006, following the birth of his son, he announced that he would take a break from touring and recording for a while. Despite this, he still played occasionally gigs. Since then he has released his fifth album FÃƒÂ¶rsent fÃƒÂ¶r Edelweiss (Too Late for Edelweiss).\n\nHellstrÃƒÂ¶m played drums in the Swedish indie pop band Broder Daniel between 1988 and 1994, and rejoined in 1997 to play the bass. Finally, he left the band again in 2003 to put complete focus on his solo career. Although sometimes accused for consistently singing out of tune, he has over time grown to be popular with all ages due to his enthusiasm, scene energy and interpretations of old popular favourites live.\n\nHellstrÃƒÂ¶m has repeatedly been criticized for plagiarism. In 2002 Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet ran an article[1] bringing attention to the similarities between his song &quot;NÃƒÂ¤r jag ser framÃƒÂ¥t&quot; and the piece Pie Jesu from Andrew Lloyd Webber&amp;#039;s Requiem. &quot;NÃƒÂ¤r jag ser framÃƒÂ¥t&quot; was the second track of the single &quot;Kom igen Lena!&quot;.\n\nAlbums\n\n    * KÃƒÂ¤nn ingen sorg fÃƒÂ¶r mig GÃƒÂ¶teborg (2000) (Platinum)\n    * Det ÃƒÂ¤r sÃƒÂ¥ jag sÃƒÂ¤ger det (2002) (Platinum)\n    * Ett kolikbarns bekÃƒÂ¤nnelser (2005) (Gold)\n    * NÃƒÂ¥t gammalt, nÃƒÂ¥t nytt, nÃƒÂ¥t lÃƒÂ¥nat, nÃƒÂ¥t blÃƒÂ¥tt (2005) (Gold)\n    * FÃƒÂ¶rsent fÃƒÂ¶r Edelweiss (2008) (Gold)\nBorn \tApril 2, 1974 (1974-04-02) (age 34),\nÃƒâ€žlvsborg, Gothenburg, Sweden\nGenre(s) \tPop\nSoul\nFolk rock\nPower pop\nAssociated acts \tBroder Daniel\nWebsite \twww.hakanhellstrom.com\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2de92a795e45044dac4f4383a38dc73c3df1e8f6","amp;dn":"H%C3%A5kan+Hellstr%C3%B6m+Live+Gr%C3%B6na++Lund+13%2F6-08++320+kb%2Fs+%28nattenevacke","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2de92a795e45044dac4f4383a38dc73c3df1e8f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,233,42,121,94,69,4,77,172,79,67,131,163,141,199,60,61,241,232,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
