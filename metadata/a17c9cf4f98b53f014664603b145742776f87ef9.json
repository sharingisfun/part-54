Moonlighting from their work as part of Siouxsie &amp; the Banshees, the duo (who would later marry) use a minimal palette (primarily vocals and drums) to create a surprisingly full sound that&amp;#039;s steeped in atmosphere (the lilting &quot;Thumb&quot; ), tribal-influenced fury (the frenetic &quot;Sky Train&quot; ), and big-band boisterousness (a horn-laden cover of Herbie Mann&amp;#039;s &quot;Right Now&quot; ), with the swinging latter style hinting at both future Banshees and Creatures outings.\n\n\n01.
