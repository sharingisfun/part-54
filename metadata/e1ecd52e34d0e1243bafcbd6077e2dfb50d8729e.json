It peaked at number thirty-three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. In the UK &quot;Bug a Boo&quot; peaked at number nine and sold over 99,400 copies. The song contains a sample of Toto&amp;#039;s 1978 &quot;Child&amp;#039;s Anthem&quot;.\n\n&quot;Bug a Boo&quot; was performed by BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© on her The BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Experience tour. It appeared as a remix in a Destiny&amp;#039;s Child medley.\n\nDespite not being a big chart hit the song&amp;#039;s music video was very popular receiving lots of airplay from both MTV and BET music networks. It was also Destiny&amp;#039;s Child first to chart on the popular TRL Top 10 countdown. The video was directed by Darren Grant.\n\nIn the video the group are walking down a shopping boulevard. Four men driving a red car who seem to be trying to attract their attention then approach them but the girlÃƒÂ¢??s of DestinyÃƒÂ¢??s Child donÃƒÂ¢??t seem very interested as the men are ÃƒÂ¢??buggingÃƒÂ¢?? them. In another shot the girls trying to escape the men accidentally run into a menÃƒÂ¢??s locker room where they see basketball star Kobe Bryant getting ready for a game. In the next shot the group are wearing cheerleader outfits doing a routine cheer with Wyclef Jean as bandleader. The marching band in the video were actual members of the UCLA Marching Band. Wyclef Jean is also seen clearly wearing the UCLA Drum Major uniform. The final shot shows the group back on the boulevard and fed up with hiding from the unwanted attention from the men in the car they give in and jump in the car and all drive off.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1ecd52e34d0e1243bafcbd6077e2dfb50d8729e","amp;dn":"Destiny%5C%27s+Child+-+Bug+A+Boo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1ecd52e34d0e1243bafcbd6077e2dfb50d8729e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,236,213,46,52,208,225,36,59,175,203,214,7,126,45,251,80,216,114,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
