Do not ever download domplayer or any other player you have never heard of as the chances are high it is a virus, spyware or malware application.\n\nGood luck, and happy viewing.\n\nPS.  This app fixes the bad header that has been applied to the video files. (this is why VLC, mplayer classic etc... will not work).\n\nSincerely\n\nMandrake\n(Canada)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f665f90f56d411d7b7a05f6ebc67636dd2473bea","amp;dn":"3wplayer+and+domplayer+file+decoders+3wdecoder","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f665f90f56d411d7b7a05f6ebc67636dd2473bea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,101,249,15,86,212,17,215,183,160,95,110,188,103,99,109,210,71,59,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
