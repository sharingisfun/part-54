They were produced in the late 1950s / early 1960s by Hy Zaret and Lou Singer. Zaret&amp;#039;s main claim to fame is writing the lyrics to the classic &quot;Unchained &gt;Melody&quot; for the 1955 movie &quot;Unchained&quot;, later recorded by the Righteous Brothers and more recently used in &quot;Ghost&quot;. Three of the albums (the best three in my opinion) were performed by Tom Glazer, semi-famous 1940s folk musician and somewhat of a lyricist himself (he wrote &quot;On Top of Spaghetti&quot;).\n\nThe Singing Science lyrics were very Atomic Age, while the tunes were generally riffs on popular or genre music of the time. We played them incessantly.\n\nIn February 1998 I found the LPs in my parents&amp;#039; basement. I cleaned them up, played them one last time on an old turntable, and burned them onto a set of three CD-R discs. In December 1999 I read the songs back off the CDs and encoded them into MP3, so now you can hear them on the web. They are available at either 32 Kbps (about half a megabyte each) or 160 Kbps (about two megabytes each). The higher-quality MP3 versions were encoded by Ron Hipschman.
