From Jane Austen to the present day, via Mills &amp; Boon, this three-part series explores the enduring appeal of the love story and the integral part it plays in readers&amp;#039; lives.\n\n\t \nNovelist Jilly Cooper \t  \tHAPPILY EVER AFTER\nJilly Cooper, Joanna Trollope, Sophie Kinsella and Marian Keyes contribute to this episode looking at how the romantic fiction industry has grown and why it remains so popular. Daisy performs a scientific experiment to explore whether reading romantic novels can lower stress levels.\n\n\t \nColin Firth as Mr Darcy \t  \tHEROES\nDaisy Goodwin finds that heroes of the 19th century - Darcy, Rochester and Heathcliff remain firm favourites for today&amp;#039;s women. She creates an E-Fit of her Mr Darcy and goes to America in search of Rhett Butler from Gone with the Wind. Interviews with P D James, Joanna Trollope and Andrew Davies.\n\n\t \nRuth Wilson as Jane Eyre \t  \tHEROINES\nContrary to what cynics might expect, romantic heroines have both reflected the times and have been role models for women. Daisy visits the set of the BBC&amp;#039;s new Jane Eyre and spends a day with a Yorkshire book group. With Barbara Taylor-Bradford, Sophie Kinsella and Marina Warner.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/romantic-fiction.shtml&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/bbcfour/documentaries/features/romantic-fiction.shtml&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f34c6399c99dd52626b2293cc3e900bc4572c518","amp;dn":"Reader%2C+I+Married+Him+%28BBC+Four%29+%28documentary%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f34c6399c99dd52626b2293cc3e900bc4572c518","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,76,99,153,201,157,213,38,38,178,41,60,195,233,0,188,69,114,197,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
