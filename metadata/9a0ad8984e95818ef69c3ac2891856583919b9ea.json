When deadly spiders escape from a top-secret Army base and are unleashed on an unsuspecting public, the military&amp;#039;s best efforts to contain the creatures are simply not enough. Tanks, specialists of all kind, and eventually weapons of mass destruction are not able to deter these seemingly indestructible monstrosities. The venomous spiders continue their rampage, capturing innocent citizens in their enormous webs and devouring them alive. Eventually the authorities are forced to make a difficult decision, and decide that the city must be demolished before the plague of spiders spreads. Disturbing special effects characterize this fright-fest, which stars Carl Washington (KILLJOY, HOOD OF THE LIVING DEAD), Garrett Clancy (CAMP BLOOD 2), and Vincent Bilancio (SORORITY HOUSE MASSACRE).\n\nCredits \nCast: Eric Flenner, Lisa Jay, Phoebe Dollar \nDirector: Jeff Leroy \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a0ad8984e95818ef69c3ac2891856583919b9ea","amp;dn":"Creepies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a0ad8984e95818ef69c3ac2891856583919b9ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,10,216,152,78,149,129,142,246,156,58,194,137,24,86,88,57,25,185,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
