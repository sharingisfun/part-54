Maiden Voyage is a masterpiece of the school, with Hancock's enduring compositions like 'Maiden Voyage' and 'Dolphin Dance' mingling creative tension and calm repose with strong melodies and airy, suspended harmonies that give form to his evocative sea imagery. Trumpeter Freddie Hubbard was at a creative peak, stretching his extraordinary technique to the limits in search of a Coltrane-like fluency on the heated 'Eye of the Storm,' while the underrated tenor saxophonist George Coleman adds a developed lyricism to the session. --Stuart Broomer\n\nTrack list\n------------\n01.
