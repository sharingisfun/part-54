These contain temperature and power consumption which could be made visable. The feature is mostly for notebook users as the ACPI tables are normally not filled out in destop mainboards.\n\n- S.M.A.R.T.\nThe Self Monitoring And Reporting Technology enables you to see the harddisk parameters. It includes a temperature readout of the harddisk. Until now only normal harddisks are supported. RAID and SCSI systems are not yet supported due to a missing microsoft driver extension. But there are no programs that support RAID / SCSI systems on the market...\n\n- Change the FrontSideBus\nWith this option you can vary the CPU frequency. Many mainbords support setting the FrontSideBus via SMBus. It is for these motherboards I have added this feature. It is for experienced users only and only at your own risk! Details\n\n- MONITORING Temperature, fan speed, voltages for many motherboards.\nThe program displays all units, connected to an I2C Bus. It works with all chipset from Intel, ALI, VIA, AMD, and SIS motherboards. You can see the temperature, voltage and fan values of your motherboard chipset,  inclusive dial-up adapter display and processor parameters. From Notebooks you can see the ACPI Temps and from NVidia Grafic cards you can look at the temps of the grafic processor and the fan speed. ATI will come soon hopefully.\n\n- CPU Cooling under Windows 95 / 98 / NT / 2000 (Watch Wintop !) There&amp;#039;s No way to switch it off! After registering you can get a small *.VXD (6K Byte) for cooling only. It works so far for all non Athlon processors and for Athlon based system with a VIA8363 and AMD760 chipset.\n\nBenifits: There is No need to turn it on or off, No overhead (CPU Time / Memory) Cooling only, and if you wish to stop using it, you simply remove it from your system! All you have to do to receive it is to register and send the file you could generate by Help -&gt; CPUCooL Info -&gt; Write to file to the author at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d6a5a3a6a6b9a4a296a6b9b2bfb3b8f8b2b3f8&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;.\n\n- CPU Optimization (AMD, Cyrix and Intel old CPU&amp;#039;s)\n\nThis is the first and only program that optimizes AMD / Cyrix  CPU&amp;#039;s complete and correct. All the other tools have bugs which I have detected when implementing my optimizations. This feature is mostly for older cpus (AMD K6, Cypress)\n\n- Memory optimization (mostly for Windows 95 / 98)\n\n- Reads out the values programmed in the E2PROM of the SDRAM&amp;#039;s.\nEvery value is decoded inclusive the SDRAM manufacturer if available.
