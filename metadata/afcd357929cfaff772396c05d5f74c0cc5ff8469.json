This tour featured some rarely played songs, especially covers, like Gram Parsons&amp;#039; &quot;Hot Burrito #1&quot; and the Rolling Stones&amp;#039; &quot;Dead Flowers.&quot; I really wish I had some more performances from this tour, as I really like it, and the performances still maintain some of the rawness of the early tours but show the evolving sound that would crystallize on the 1994 tour..\n\n \n\nThis is the first show from the 1992 tour in the SOTM download series. A few notes: originally, whoever sent this to me marked it as a soundboard. Upon listening, it turns out to be an audience tape. Additionally, there is a bit missing from the beginning of both &quot;&amp;#039;Cause Cheap is How I Feel&quot; and &quot;Walking After Midnight,&quot; both of which fade in so there isn&amp;#039;t a hard cut in. It&amp;#039;s still quite good, though there is a little more noise than I thought. However, given the setlist and the quality of the performance, I still think it a valuable archival moment, and a show the llamas voted on for release. ENJOY!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afcd357929cfaff772396c05d5f74c0cc5ff8469","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies+1992-02-13+%40+Phoenix+Theater+-+Petaluma%2C+CA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afcd357929cfaff772396c05d5f74c0cc5ff8469","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,205,53,121,41,207,175,247,114,57,108,5,213,247,76,12,197,255,132,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
