When the family, accompanied by Bobby&amp;#039;s Nanny and an attorney, enter the house they find themselves trapped inside an evil machine &quot;designed by the devil and powered by the dead&quot; to open the Eye of Hell. Aided by Dennis, a ghost hunter, and his rival Kalina, a ghost rights activist out to set the ghosts free, the group must do what they can to get out of the house alive. \n\nThis is a great freaky movie imo.\n\nNTSC Widescreen English and French languages and subs.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74a9d8cbc06e8c26c3bb1956a8f89f116f690414","amp;dn":"Thirteeen+Ghosts+2001+NTSC+DVDR+WS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74a9d8cbc06e8c26c3bb1956a8f89f116f690414","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,169,216,203,192,110,140,38,195,187,25,86,168,248,159,17,111,105,4,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
