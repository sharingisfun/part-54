Everyone differently now dead. On one of my solitary voyages to the ruins of urban landscape I found a half of portable computer buried in sand. It was rusted and full with the scratches, the broken screen, but it seemed intact.\n\nI brought back it to the laboratory and indeed it started with the power starting from my generator. The computer was full with the noises and with strange samples, loosely organized together in the folders called hidden. There was also a visual file of television, one documentary about the fall of civilization. It was full with the fictitious characters. I organized the noises in with formed album and now I listen to this music when I walk my long voyages along the abandoned roads.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:91ab8976e4e67caed75c19cd3b5f19660dee058f","amp;dn":"Nebular+Spool+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"91ab8976e4e67caed75c19cd3b5f19660dee058f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,171,137,118,228,230,124,174,215,92,25,205,59,95,25,102,13,238,5,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
