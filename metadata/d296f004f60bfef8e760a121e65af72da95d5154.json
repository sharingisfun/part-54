(&quot;You&amp;#039;re a bottle cap away / From pushing me too far.&quot;) Drawing from each of their six albums, Old 97&amp;#039;s brought the crowd at Santa Monica&amp;#039;s Troubadour club to visible delirium at a March 2004 show; that concert appears here. Sounding very much like hard-charging heirs to vast legacies of the Kinks, Hank Williams, the Replacements, Johnny Cash, REM, and even White Album-era Beatles, singer-songwriter-guitarist Rhett Miller, drummer Philip Peeples, lead guitarist Ken Bethea, and bassist Murry Hammond paint loss with rootsy-poetic authenticity while blowing gloom apart with punky exhilaration. The many highlights include the agreeable pop plaint &quot;Rollerskate Skinny&quot; (&quot;I believe in love / But it don&amp;#039;t believe in me&quot;), the anthemic anti-anthem &quot;Friends Forever,&quot; and Hammond&amp;#039;s moving, acoustic solo on &quot;Valentine.&quot; --Tom Keogh\n\n1  Just Like California\n2  King Of The World\n3  Weightless\n4  Rollerskate Skinny\n5  Won&amp;#039;t Be Home\n6  Smokers\n7  Melt Snow\n8  Wish The Worst\n9  Lonely Boy\n10 Up The Devil&amp;#039;s Pay\n11 Friends Forever\n12 The New Kid\n13 Jagged\n14 Four Leaf Clover\n15 Question\n16 Valentine\n17 Murder ( Or A Heart Attack )\n18 Doreen\n19 Big Brown Eyes\n20 Time Bomb\n21 End Credits\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d296f004f60bfef8e760a121e65af72da95d5154","amp;dn":"Old+97s+Live+%28Ripped+from+2005+DVD%29+%5BOGG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d296f004f60bfef8e760a121e65af72da95d5154","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,150,240,4,246,11,254,248,231,96,161,33,230,90,247,45,169,93,81,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
