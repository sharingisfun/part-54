If everything is black, set the lighting setting a notch down. All the original Q1 maps have lightingmaps.\n\nI hope you&amp;#039;ll enjoy this. This is my first attempt at creating something original to upload - besides ripping a CD.\n\n-yog","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb840bee829897d578b1daec8b3451f58890962a","amp;dn":"QUAKE+1+-+ultra+pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb840bee829897d578b1daec8b3451f58890962a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,132,11,238,130,152,151,213,120,177,218,236,139,52,81,245,136,144,150,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
