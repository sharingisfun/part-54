Thanks again for all your hard work!\n\n&quot;Basically, I took the videos available on Youtube, plus the ones I myself took at the show and made a video out of them (about an hour total.) If there was more than one recording of a song, I used the best audio and the best video from the various sources and made sure the picture matched the sound. It&amp;#039;s not perfect; obviously video and sound quality aren&amp;#039;t great, since my primary source was Youtube. But it&amp;#039;s pretty watchable.\n\nDead Leaves and the Dirty Ground\nI Think I Smell a Rat (a little over half-way through), falls into\nIcky Thump...he pushed the organ all over the place, climbed up the stairs and encouraged the crowd to clap along\nWhen I Hear My Name\nHotel Yorba\nThe Denial Twist...some alternate lyrics and Meg holding back on drums\nDeath Letter intro...slides into a &amp;#039;lil possible Catch Hell intro...falls back into...\nDeath Letter...alternate lyrics for chorus &quot;Got 10,000 women on my front porch, didn&amp;#039;t know wether to listen to &amp;#039;em or to keep on headin&amp;#039; north&quot; really insane version of this song\nDo...drug out the last verse with &quot;scratchin&amp;#039;, itchin&amp;#039;.....Brother John &amp; Sister Moon won&amp;#039;t you tell me what I&amp;#039;m supposed to Do..&quot;\nI&amp;#039;m Slowly Turning Into You...disco ball during the chorus, such an incredible effect. walked up the stairs to the right of the stage and down the ones to the far left and had the crowd sing along\nIn the Cold, Cold Night...Jack introduces Meg to Alabama and she then sings beautifuly and steps to the organ to play along like she has been recently\nI Wanna be the Boy to Warm Your Mothers Heart...plays both the organ and slide guitar\nSeven Nation Army...starts out strong and is standing on the front amps, but then says &quot;I don&amp;#039;t know if we shoudl play this song in America anymore...guess it doesn&amp;#039;t translate well...lost something in the translation&quot; and stops! Amazing!!!!\nAstro...just incredible...actually gets through most of the song &amp;#039;till after the &quot;Edison is AC/DC&quot; line, then proceeds to stomp up the center stairs and once e top begins playing\nJack the Ripper!!!!!! The whole song...total powerhouse.\n\nEncore :\n\nLittle Cream Soda (full version, indeed)\nA Martyr For my Love For You...extra long finish on this one...really drug it out\nOne More Cup of Coffee...played on airline\n300 mph Outpour Blues...some alternate lyrics, &quot;All kinds of emotions that a phone call ain&amp;#039;t gonna fix&quot;...really crazy ending\nWe&amp;#039;re Going to be Friends...crowd sings last verse\nIJDKWTDWM...crowd singing chorus\nBall and Biscuit...maybe a little &quot;Cool Drink of Water&quot; into the mic sitting on the back amps? couldn&amp;#039;t really hear...calls out Meg at the end, &quot;Let&amp;#039;s have a ball Meg&quot; and then changes the lyrics after that, but I couldnt&amp;#039; decypher...lots of organ to solo to organ to solo on this one\nBoil Weevil...and you know the rest of this story.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9be47e15939154c37ec865fa5df8e348ea1ab16","amp;dn":"The+White+Stripes+2007-07-30+-+Sloss+Furances%2C+Birmingham%2C+AL+%28v","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9be47e15939154c37ec865fa5df8e348ea1ab16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,190,71,225,89,57,21,76,55,236,134,95,165,223,142,52,142,161,171,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
