Monsters currently airs on NBC Universal&amp;#039;s horror-themed channel Chiller Saturdays at 5PM and 5:30PM, Sundays at 11AM and 11:30AM, and intermittently weekday mornings at 5AM and/or 5:30AM Eastern.\n\nA horror anthology show in a similar vein to Tales from the Darkside, it shared the same producer (Richard P. Rubenstein), and in some ways succeeded the show (which had ended the same year in which Monsters began). It differed in some respects nonetheless. While Tales sometimes dabbled in stories of science fiction and fantasy, this series was more strictly horror. As the name implies, each episode of Monsters (with very few exceptions) featured a different monster which the story concerned, from the animatronic puppet of a fictional children&amp;#039;s television program to mutated, weapon-wielding lab rats.\n\n\n(Taken from http://en.wikipedia.org)\n\nContents of download:  Monsters- Season 3\n\n Monsters S03E01 Stressed Environment.avi (175.08 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E02 Murray&amp;#039;s Monster.avi (174.78 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E03 Bug House.avi (175.08 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E04 Cellmates.avi (174.8 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E05 Outpost.avi (174.77 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E06 The Hole.avi (175.06 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E07 Small Blessings.avi (174.76 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E08 A Shave and a Haircut, Two Bites.avi (174.79 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E09 The Young and the Headless.avi (175.08 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E10 The Waiting Game.avi (174.8 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E11 Sin-Sop.avi (175.22 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E12 A New Woman.avi (175.17 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E13 Malcolm.avi (175.13 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E14 Household Gods.avi (175.09 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E15 The Space Eaters.avi (175.06 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E16 The Waiting Room.avi (174.77 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E17 Leavings.avi (175.08 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E18 Desirable Alien.avi (175.77 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E19 A Face for Radio.avi (175.08 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E20 Werewolf of Hollywood.avi (175.08 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E21 Talk Nice to Me.avi (174.78 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E22 Hostile Takeover.avi (174.78 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E23 The Maker.avi (174.79 megabyte)\n Monsters S03E24 The Moving Finger.avi (175.07 megabyte)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac1fd3d77b2c87991122137412bb76698f7fd461","amp;dn":"Monsters-+Season+3+Complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac1fd3d77b2c87991122137412bb76698f7fd461","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,31,211,215,123,44,135,153,17,34,19,116,18,187,118,105,143,127,212,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
