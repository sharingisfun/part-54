Despite early success, conflicts lead to the band splitting up while recording their debut album.\n\nHere are almost all the studio tracks the band recorded in 2007.  Their sound is a mix of Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, and Jimi Hendrix.\n\nThe music was recorded by John Gallagher and produced by John Gallagher and Jonathan Schlackman.\n\nSexor Suicide (the band that almost was):\nRibal Rayess - vocals\nAnthony Sgaraglio - drums\nJohn Gallagher - bass\nJonathan Schlackman - guitar\n\nNo love songs here. Just agressive satisfying Rock from the NYC Underground. Besides some really good riffs and grooves, what made Sexor Suicide stand out was the guitar playing of Jonathan Schlackman- one of the finest unknown players to ever come out of the Big Apple.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c927d67dc5c8f3afc4e36b0350debc90936fd362","amp;dn":"Almost+Was+EP+%28Mp4%29+Sexor+Suicide+-+Zeppelin+Sabbath+Metal+Rock","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c927d67dc5c8f3afc4e36b0350debc90936fd362","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,39,214,125,197,200,243,175,196,227,107,3,80,222,188,144,147,111,211,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
