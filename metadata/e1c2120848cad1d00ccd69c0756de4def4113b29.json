This EP is much shorter than my last release, but I like to think that this is much tighter and more fun to listen to than Penny Pony Rides.\n\nDenvertronic.com said: &quot;Another fab release from Digital Grampa 2000. A little noise, a little gabber, a little industrial, with a pinch of self destruction and youve got the ingredients for a good time. I agree: screw generic dance music. Rock on with your bad self.&quot;\n\nAlbum is sampled in high-bitrate mp3 and comes bundled with original artwork by System Override, and other goodies.\n\nTrack listing:\n01.
