The time is 1941: a crowded bus travels over unpaved Yugoslavian terrain. In the manner of Stagecoach, the audience comes to know and grow fond of the various passengers: the lovers, the politician, the eccentrics, etc (each character is played by a well-known Yugoslav movie personality). The film's genial mood is unexpectedly shattered when a Nazi bomb scores a direct hit on the bus. The only surviving passengers are a pair of travelling gypsy musiciansÃ¢â‚¬â€hence the film's title.  \n\n\nIMDB rating: 8/10\n\nAudio: Serbian\nSubs:  Slovenian\n\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076276/\n\n100% DVD digitally remastered\n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6497edcab56d0e032976a1c068e85727698eebf","amp;dn":"Ko+to+tamo+peva+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6497edcab56d0e032976a1c068e85727698eebf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,73,126,220,171,86,208,224,50,151,106,28,6,142,133,114,118,152,238,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
