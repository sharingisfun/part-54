Moral Dilemmas ensue, powerful scenes throughout &amp; great acting makes this subtitled film well worth the watch.\n\n\n\n\n\nI took the Rar-d file from a private torrent - took forever to get, im passing on to TPB-ers without all the kerfuffle i had, so please make sure you seed it.\n\n\nI hope you enjoy this as much as i did.  SEED, SEED, SEED \n\nClean, good quality, as only you deserve!!\n\noH!  Did i say? ...... Seed, for at least 1:1 ratio.... more if you can, to keep it alive..Thanks\n\nSquashydog  :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fda044b47bc8a05d8bec805f5b12963eaab2e58b","amp;dn":"The.Counterfeiter.2007.avi.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fda044b47bc8a05d8bec805f5b12963eaab2e58b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,160,68,180,123,200,160,93,139,236,128,95,91,18,150,62,170,178,229,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
