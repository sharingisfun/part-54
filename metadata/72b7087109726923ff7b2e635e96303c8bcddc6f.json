It features explicit content (images of blood and gore) therefore it was published as a MAX imprint. It was written by Garth Ennis and drawings were by Glenn Fabry. \n\nThe story is of some dead Vikings attacking New York and with a magic force that even Mighty Thor cannot face them. If you can stand gore then the artwork is very good and you will relish collecting them and reading them. Enjoy and Seed.
