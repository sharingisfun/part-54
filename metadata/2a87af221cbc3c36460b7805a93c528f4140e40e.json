Burke and co-produced with Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal for TriBeCa Productions in 1993. The series theme song, &quot;Keep It Going,&quot; was performed by the alternative hip hop artist Me Phi Me.\n\nFor his performance in the lead role of Martin McHenry in the season opener, &quot;The Box,&quot; Laurence Fishburne won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor - Drama Series.\n\nNoted for attracting &quot;actors, writers and directors of uncommon quality,&quot; and set in New York City&amp;#039;s lower Manhattan neighborhood of TriBeCa, the series was aired by the Fox Broadcasting Company. The stellar casts, with series regulars Philip Bosco and Joe Morton, included Eli Wallach, Kevin Spacey, Kathleen Quinlan, Melanie Mayron, Judith Malina, Carl Lumbly, Richard Lewis, Carol Kane, Debbie Harry, Dizzy Gillespie and Danny Aiello III.\n\nDirectors and scriptwriters included David J. Burke, Hans Tobeason, John Mankiewicz of the prolific Mankiewicz family, Barry Primus, Bryan Spicer and several actors in the series, among others.\n\n\n\nThis is a low quality rip from a VHS tape of the TV broadcast back in 1993.\n\nEpisode 6 &quot;The Loft&quot;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a87af221cbc3c36460b7805a93c528f4140e40e","amp;dn":"Tribeca+S1E06+The+Loft","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a87af221cbc3c36460b7805a93c528f4140e40e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,135,175,34,28,188,60,54,70,11,120,5,169,60,82,143,65,64,228,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
