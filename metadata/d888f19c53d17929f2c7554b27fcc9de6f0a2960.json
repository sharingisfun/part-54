What is it?\nAutoLoader is an efficient way to edit many files sequentially inside of Photoshop CS2. Inspired by a colleague of mine who\nroutinely edits hundreds of files individually, it will allow you to sequentially load a directory of images into Photoshop CS2\none after the other, with a single keystroke. It is both workflow efficient and resource efficient. Read on for how.\nPart 2. Why is it Useful?\nThe Short Answer\nAutoLoader will let you open all files in a folder sequentially without wasting excess time doing the manual file save-file\nclose-file open mouse work, and without wasting system resources by opening many files at once.\nThe Long Answer\nThis question is best answered using an example. Consider the situation faced by Mike the wedding photographer. After a\ntypical shoot he is faced with the task of individually adjusting 500 photos. How can he go about doing this?\nMethod 1: Manually opening files one by one\nOne way is to manually open each image, one after the other, using the mouse or keyboard. This is perfectly workable.\nHowever, from a workflow efficiency standpoint, it is not a very good solution. To close the current image and open the\nnext one in Photoshop, the flow looks like this:\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ click File, then click Save\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ possibly get a folder dialog, in which you minimally have to click OK\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ possibly get the JPEG options dialog, in which you minimally have to click OK\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ click File, then click Close\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ click File, then click Open\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ double-click the next file in the Browse dialog to open it\nAll in all, a lot of mouse clicking. This process can be sped up using the keyboard, but it doesnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t change the fact that you\nhave to use five events to switch to the next file. Remember, when we have 500 images to process, all that repetition is\ntedious and time consuming (not to mention rough on the fingers if youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½re using the keyboard). Consider: assuming it takes\nyou 10 seconds to perform the steps above, for 500 images that is 83 minutes of nothing but closing and opening files.\nMethod 2: Drop sets of files into Photoshop\nAnother way would be to drag and drop lots of files into Photoshop all at once. This gets around the problem of having to\nclose and open files all the time, but itÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s not very efficient from a system resources standpoint. Say you drop a set of 50 files\nat a time into Photoshop. Only one of them can be worked on at any given time, so 49 of those files are doing nothing but\nsitting there, taking up system resources while they wait their turn.\nMethod 3: AutoLoader\nAutoLoader combines all five steps required to save and close the currently open file and open the next one for editing into\na single keystroke.\nAutoLoader consists of two scripts that work together. The first script, called AutoLoader-Set, has a GUI that lets you\nset the options for the script, such as the folder containing the files to process, and the type of files to open (JPEG, TIFF or\nPSD). Once these selections are made, it saves two config files: the general config file contains the selected information, and\nthe folder config file holds information specific to this run, such as an index of the last file opened.\nThe second script, called AutoLoader-Next, does all the magic. It closes all open files (saving changes) and then opens\nup the next file in the selected folder, using the index in the folder config file to tell it where it left off. Once it finds the next\nfile in the list and opens it, the folder config file is updated with the new ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½last openedÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ index, and the script then exits.\nWhat does this mean to you? Well, once youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ve use AutoLoader-Set to where to load the files from, and youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ve\nassigned AutoLoader-Next to a keyboard command, the same process that took five steps using Method 1 and\nclogged your system resources in Method 2, is reduced to a single keystroke that opens each file in the folder one at a time.\nNo carpal tunnel syndrome from 83 minutes of file management, and no 49 RAM-gobbling images opened and waiting for\ntheir turn.\nPart 3: New Stuff in Version 2\nChanges from Version 1 include:\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ you can specify a folder to save the edited files to (in version 1, the edited files overwrote the original files)\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ the script can remember where it left off, so you can switch between processing runs and not lose your place\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ more save options are available, including flattening\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ the JPEG and TIFF save options dialogs are suppressed\nPart 4: Setting Up the Script\nWith your distribution, you should have received:\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ The AutoLoader Scripts (ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½AutoLoader2-Set.jsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½AutoLoader2-Next.jsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½).\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ This manual.\nEach file must be installed correctly for the script to run. HereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s what to do.\n1. If it\\&amp;#039;s open, close Photoshop.\n2. Copy ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½AutoLoader2-Set.jsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ and ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½AutoLoader2-Next.jsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ to the Scripts directory.\nC:\\\\Program Files\\\\Adobe\\\\Photoshop CS\\\\Presets\\\\Scripts\nMacintosh HD/Applications/Photoshop CS/Presets/Scripts\n3. Open Photoshop.\nThe script is now installed correctly, and you should see both AutoLoader-Set and AutoLoader-Next under File,\nScripts. Now that everything is set up, weÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½re ready to actually use the script.\nPart 5: Using the Script\nWhen you have a folder containing a bunch of files you want to process through Photoshop one by one, hereÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s what to do.\n1. Launch AutoLoader2-Set\nWhen you start AutoLoader2-Set, the GUI will load up,\nas seen to the left.\nThere are two sections that need to be set up. The File\nLoading Options tells the script the location of the folder\ncontaining the files to open and the file types to open.\nYouÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll notice a checkbox there tooÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦new in this version is the\nability to switch between processing sets. So, if a folder\nconfig file is found in the Save Folder (selected in the next\nsection), this option will be selectable.\nThe second section tells the script where and how to save the\nopen file. The folder to save to, the file type to save\nasÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦straightforward stuff\nWhen you click Save and close the config files will be written\nand youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½re ready to begin.\n2. Assign AutoLoader2-Next to a keyboard shortcut. This is the best way to launch AutoLoader2-Next.\nAssigning keystrokes is done within Photoshop, in the dialog opened by clicking Edit, Keyboard Shortcuts in the\nmenu system. For purposes of description, IÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll assume you assigned AutoLoader2-Next to the F3 key.\n3. Hit F3 to run AutoLoader2-Next. The first image will open. Edit it to your hearts content. Note that there is no\nuser interface for this script.\n4. When youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½re finished editing, hit F3 again. AutoLoader2-Next will save your file to the folder chosen as the\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Save folderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ option, close the file, and the next file will be loaded.\nThatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s it. Keep hitting F3 to move to the next image in the queue. Easy as pie.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d888f19c53d17929f2c7554b27fcc9de6f0a2960","amp;dn":"Autoloader+for+Photoshop+CS2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d888f19c53d17929f2c7554b27fcc9de6f0a2960","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,136,241,156,83,209,121,41,242,199,85,75,39,252,201,222,111,10,41,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
