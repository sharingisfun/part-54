Sometime during the three years following \nits founding by Sir Walter Raleigh in the late 16th century, the colonists of Roanoke, Virginia went \nmissing and were never heard from again. When supply ships finally returned to the colony in 1591 \nthere wasn\\&amp;#039;t a soul to be found and any clues to what had happened were virtually nonexistent. \nTheories have bound ever since that the colonists got massacred or abducted by local natives or \nthat they may have even been swept out to sea in a storm. The tale of this lost colony certainly \nmade prime fodder for Leonard Nimoy\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;In Search Of\\&quot; and it should come as no surprise that the Sci-Fi \nChannel would eventually come a calling and make a movie putting an otherworldly spin on the tale.\n\n\nWraiths of Roanoke (originally titled The Lost Colony) purports to tell the true story of Roanoke but \nwith a supernatural twist; the colonists fall victim to wrathful wraiths that haunt the tiny island on \nwhich Roanoke was settled. What we have here is a low rent period hybrid of Evil Dead, The Fog, and The Village.\n\nHighlander 2.0 Adrian Paul is Ananias Dare, who along with his pregnant wife Eleanor, are amongst the \nfirst settlers of the new world. Ananias and his best friend George (Asylum graduate Rhett Giles) are \namongst the few to discover that the person who had been left behind previously to stand guard over \nthe fort until the colonists arrived had hung himself in a locked building with a primitive moat of \nsorts built around it. He left behind an ominous warning: \\&quot;Save your soul before they take it from you.\\&quot; \nBelieving the man had just gone mad and not wanting to alarm the rest of the newcomers, \nthey decide to not share this with the rest.\n\nNo sooner do they arrive Eleanor has a bad dream about ghosts taking her unborn baby. \nSo traumatic is this dream that she goes into labor and gives birth to a baby girl. \nShe begs Ananias to go back to England because she senses that there\\&amp;#039;s something seriously bad about \nthe island. He refuses because he\\&amp;#039;d made a promise to help maintain the island in case England goes to \nwar with Spain. The local Crow Indians also warn of evil spirits roaming the forest and that the white \nman will suffer if they don\\&amp;#039;t leave.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dreadcentral.com/node/25015&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dreadcentral.com/node/25015&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nTorrent geplaatst door het nummereen TEAm &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nummereen.nl.eu.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nummereen.nl.eu.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIn samenwerking met: NLT forum   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nlt.ons-forum.nl/index.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nlt.ons-forum.nl/index.php&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c736699311781b30bfcd6108211f2250a2c1f644","amp;dn":"LOST+COLONY+2008+%2FRelease+Date%3A13+October+2007+%28USA%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c736699311781b30bfcd6108211f2250a2c1f644","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,54,105,147,17,120,27,48,191,205,97,8,33,31,34,80,162,193,246,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
