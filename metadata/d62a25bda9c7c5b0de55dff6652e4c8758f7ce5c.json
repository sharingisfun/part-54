This initial edition in the 12 volume (!) Japanese History Of Schema series features a look at the label at 3 different levels -- the &quot;early years&quot;, music recorded at a time when there was still some shared energy between Schema and Right Tempo; the &quot;soundtracks&quot;, work that wasn&amp;#039;t really used in films, but strongly inspired by cinematic efforts of the 60s and 70s; and &quot;the jazz&quot; -- core instrumental grooves either by older or current groups, all with that rich Italian sound that&amp;#039;s been at the heart of Schema from the start.\n\n--\nOriginally uploaded by DADA Van De Graaf (a.k.a.
