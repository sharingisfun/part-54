But we&amp;#039;re discovering a new and frightening side to our star. A kind of solar rage peaks every eleven years. \nAnd sometimes, Earth is in the line of fire. It&amp;#039;s a billion pounds of matter traveling at a million miles an hour - a solar blast - which could send us scrambling. \nWithout warning, navigation systems could be disrupted, blinding jets in the sky. Phone connections around the world could go dead, leaving us stranded during emergencies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9bb57dc0f5afc692f917e36820cdd65cadf8b317","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Solar.Blast.DivX.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9bb57dc0f5afc692f917e36820cdd65cadf8b317","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,181,125,192,245,175,198,146,249,23,227,104,32,205,214,92,173,248,179,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
