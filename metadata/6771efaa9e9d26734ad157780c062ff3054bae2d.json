Rifling through a kind of lurching punk-funk, this San Pedro, California, trio poses philosophical questions, mocks love-song clichÃƒÂ©s and Michael Jackson, covers CCR and Van Halen, and gets drunk on 'Jesus and Tequila'--all of it brought to life by the jazzy, popping bass of Mike Watt; the rifle-shot fills of drummer George Hurley, and the staccato guitar and impassioned cries of the late D. Boon, whose voice will forever insist: 'No hope? See, that's what gives me guts.' --David Cantwell\n\n\n01. D.'s Car Jam/Anxious Mo-Fo\n02. Theatre Is the Life of You\n03. Viet Nam\n04. Cohesion\n05.
