Over 2000 articles, varying in length from 500 to 15,000 words, cover philosophical thought from antiquity to the present. Entries range from individuals (Kant, Simone Weil) to philosophical issues and theories (Utilitarianism, Justice, Agnosticism, Buddhist Philosophy, Free Will, Trust) and current issues (e.g., Structuralism, Postcolonialism, and Feminism). The disc offers a variety of access points: Philosophical Themes, World Philosophies, and World Religions. These broad headings are further subdivided by topic, and you can get a list of topics by time period. The inexperienced philosopher will find this a useful way to get acquainted with the themes, individuals, terminology, and history of a field, while the scholar will be able to exploit the breadth and nuances of philosophical thought in full. The search engine is highly flexible, allowing standard Boolean and proximity searching. The Bottom Line: Highly recommended; a required purchase for all public and academic libraries.
