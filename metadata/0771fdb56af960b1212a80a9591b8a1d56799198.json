Jason talks with Mark Dice, founder of The Resistance, who was recently on the receiving end of a death threat issued by neocon talkshow host Michael Reagan.\n\nI haven't listened to this one, just cut the commercials.  It seems to start with Alex, but Jason Bermas comes on later in the show to host.  \n\nSourced from the infowars podcast.  Four hours before commercial edit.  Total time is 3:01.  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0771fdb56af960b1212a80a9591b8a1d56799198","amp;dn":"Alex.Jones.Show.2008.06.16-chakra71","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0771fdb56af960b1212a80a9591b8a1d56799198","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,113,253,181,106,249,96,177,33,42,128,169,89,27,138,29,86,121,145,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
