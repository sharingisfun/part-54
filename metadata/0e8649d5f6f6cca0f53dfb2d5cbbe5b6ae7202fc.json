Extremly beutiful, surreal and with a (as always in ButtgereitÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s movies) superb soundtrack.\n\nLothar Schramm (Florian Koerner von Gustorf) is dying, face down in a pool of his own blood. Behind his closed eyes, fractured memories repeat themselves in a neuronal fire. He runs by the sea. He lusts after the whore (Monika M) across the hall. He staggers through life uncertainly. He kills.\n\nSchramm is the story of the notorious Lipstick Killer Lothar SchrammÃƒÂ¢??s last days on earth. Revealed in a series of tightly constructed flashbacks, the film offers an unflinching look into the mind of a serial killer. \n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Today I am dirty, but tomorrow IÃƒÂ¢??ll be just dirt.Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â´\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nEncoded with DVD-Shrink.
