This is a fast growing program so look\nforward to another package as more games are added. I will not be seeding older\nROM pack torrents.\n\nYou can find FreePlay here: http://2dfighter.com/\n\nIf you&amp;#039;re new to FreePlay be sure to read and follow the instructions on how\nto get started carefully (found on the home page of the website).\n\nIt would help a lot if people would seed more this time around. PLEASE SEED.\n\nAbout FreePlay:\n&quot;FreePlay is a meeting ground where you can chat with and challenge other\nplayers from around the world to play in a wide selection of arcade-perfect\nemulated games.\n\nFeatures:\n* Instant replays.\n* Private messaging.\n* Detailed stat tracking (overall wins/losses, character specific wins/losses, \netc.)\n* Automated player rating system.\n* Ignore harassing players.\n* P2P connection for best performance.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nYou use the 2DF FreePlay Client to connect to the 2DF FreePlay Server. After \nchallenging or accepting a challenge from another player in the game of your \nchoice, the game is automatically launched and the players automatically \nconnected. No need to worry about mismatching emulator versions or swapping IP \naddresses.&quot;\n\nFreePlay is created by damdai.
