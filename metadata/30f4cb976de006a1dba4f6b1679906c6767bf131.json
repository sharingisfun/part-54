Ralph Records fed him a strict diet of records, and this is the result.\n\nThe record features The Residents, Snakefinger, Tuxedomoon, Fred Frith, Yello, Renaldo &amp;amp; The Loaf, MX-80 Sound, Chrome and Art Bears.\n\n----\n\nThis marks the beginning of another bout of The Residents albums, and\npossibly some of the DVDs as my bandwidth is upgraded. Next up are\ntwo versions of the live Mole Show.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30f4cb976de006a1dba4f6b1679906c6767bf131","amp;dn":"The+Residents+and+friends+-+Ralph+Records+10th+Anniversary+Radio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30f4cb976de006a1dba4f6b1679906c6767bf131","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,244,203,151,109,224,6,161,219,164,246,177,103,153,6,198,118,123,241,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
