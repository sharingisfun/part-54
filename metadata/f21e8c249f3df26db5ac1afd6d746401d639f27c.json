I am still thankful to god that I found it. Cant believe they aren't more famous then they are.  \n\n\n\nThe Blue Pearls are a band from Sweden playing the music they love. They communicate their own blues and rock feeling, which is improvisational innovative music - rooted in blues.\n\nYou can find bands who imitate blues music because they think it's &quot;hip&quot;. More rarely you will find groups like The Blue Pearls who actually can play the blues and stick loyal to it's simplicity and musical magic.\n\nWithout B.B. King and Elmore James there would not have been a Fleetwood Mac. Consequently you can say that The Blue Pearls are a result of their inspires Fleetwood Mac. \n\nMore info at: http://www.thebluepearls.com/theband.htm","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f21e8c249f3df26db5ac1afd6d746401d639f27c","amp;dn":"The+Blue+Pearls+-+Live+At+Swedish+Radio+Station","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f21e8c249f3df26db5ac1afd6d746401d639f27c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,30,140,36,159,61,242,109,181,172,26,253,109,116,100,1,214,57,242,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
