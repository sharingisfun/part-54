The loss of Habeas Corpus and Posse Comitatus, coupled with a new definition of ?torture? are just the tip of the Orwellian iceberg. If enacted, HR 1955 will for the first time put ?thought crime? laws on the books, robbing citizens of their right to freedom of conscience thought. \n\nThe American people know in their hearts that a problem exists in our current political structure and their solutions are simple, direct, and honest.  Washington, You?re Fired captures the spirit and zest of an old fashioned Boston tea party and captivatingly delivers the audience an education into legislation that will affect them and generations of Americans to come.\n\n&quot;Washington, You&amp;#039;re Fired&quot; is a chance for every American to play a serious game of political &quot;catch-up&quot; minus the partisan punch lines.  We&amp;#039;ll examine both sides of the political aisle exposing some of the most damning laws ever enacted in any country, while at the same time providing the audience with solutions and a game plan.\n\n\n\nThank You for your ATTENTION,\n\n\nGeorg\naka 911Revolution &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://911Revolution.magnify.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://911Revolution.magnify.net&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTags:\n\njackson jesus joke katara kid kids kiss kitten kitty leah life live livevideo lol love mad magic model \n\nmoney motorcycle movie music music video naked naruto nes news nintendo nohogirls parody party people \n\npets phantom piano police politics prank productions race racing random rap raven religion robin robot \n\nchicken rock sad scary school science sex sexy show silly singer singing snow  soccer sokka song south \n\nof nowhere  spashley spoof sport sports star strip stupid subscribers teen teen titans thong  titans \n\ntoph trailer travel trick truth tv  ufo usa video video blog vipor231 vlog war webcam wehogirls weird \n\nwinter women work world wrestling wtc wwe youtube zuko 2008 abstract Adverse-effects animals autism \n\navian influenza Bioinformatics blog bone books brain breast cancer cancer chemistry Chinese citation \n\ncitesme classification climate change commentary data mining database de Development differentiation \n\nDisease dynamics e-learning EBV evolution expression fish fish oil Free gene expression genome science \n\nsculpture security sex silly space sports technology television terror terrorism torture travel tv uk \n\nus usa video videogames war web weird women writing wtf wwii youtube kay parker kayparker noplane911 \n\n911taboo nobrainsnoplanes genghis6199 webfairy killtown bsregistration coffinman 911revolution \n\nclitorrent livevideo NPT septemberclues socialservice nico haupt 9/11 wtc conspiracy speak rumple we2ru \n\nwhoiskilltown noplane911 www.911taboo.com http://91taboo.com 911taboo nobrainsnoplanes genghis6199 \n\nwebfairy killtown bsregistration coffinman 911revolution clitorrent livevideo NPT septemberclues \n\nsocialservice nico haupt 9/11 wtc conspiracy speak rumple we2ru whoiskilltown 911 9/11 tv-fakery \n\nkilltown hoax genghis6199 spineymedia bsregistartion 911Revolutiongeomorphology guide HIV human \n\ninformation internet IVIG job la language listings literature medical melanoma meningitis method \n\nmethods migration modern Molecular mouse nanotechnology nature network news online pathology podcast \n\nProject publishing research review RNAi robot RSS scholarly communication science scuola semantic web \n\nSkin Social Software statistics stress TIC tips to transcription treatment venezia video wavelet \n\nwdin.blogspot.com web web2.0 wildlife Wnt 2007 2007 resolution 43 things 43things activism adventure \n\nanimals appearance art band beauty birthday blog body book books business buy car career celebrity \n\nchallenge change charity cheers children clean cleaning clothes college communication community \n\ncomputer computers confidence cooking craft crafts create creative creativity culture daily dance \n\ndesign diet discipline disney channel dream dreams eat eating education energy entertainment \n\nenvironment europe exercise experience faith family fashion fear film finance finances financial \n\nfitness food football freedom friend friends friendship fun funny future games garden gerard way goal \n\ngoals god growth guitar hair hannah montana happiness happy health healthy help history hobbies hobby \n\nholiday home house independence inspiration internet job joy kids knowledge language languages learn \n\nlearning life lifestyle literature live living lose weight love marriage mcr me meditation memories \n\nmental health miley cyrus mind misspelled goal money movie movies music my chemical romance nature \n\nnovel organization organize outdoors party passion peace people personal personal development pets \n\nphilosophy photography photos pictures play poetry politics productivity programming read reading \n\nrelationship relationships \nTorrent Reactor -
