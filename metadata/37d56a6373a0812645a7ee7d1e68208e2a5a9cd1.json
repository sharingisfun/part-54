is basically a love letter to dance music in new  \n  york city. what i love about the new york approach to dance      \n  music is the eclecticism and the open minded-ness on the part    \n  of the musicians, the dj&amp;#039;s, and the people in the bars and      \n  clubs. in making &amp;#039;last night&amp;#039; i essentially tried to take a      \n  long 8 hour night out in new york city and condense it into a    \n  65 minute long album.&amp;#039;                                          \n                                                                  \n  you can download the last night sampler free from                \n  moby.rcrdlbl.com                                                \n                                                                  \n  Note: track #15 Lucy Vida [Hidden Track] in track #14    \n\nThis is not your normal MP3 album, this is the VBR, which means quailty, so enjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37d56a6373a0812645a7ee7d1e68208e2a5a9cd1","amp;dn":"Moby+-+Last+Night+%5BResource+RG%5D+++++++++++++++++++++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37d56a6373a0812645a7ee7d1e68208e2a5a9cd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,213,106,99,115,160,129,38,69,167,238,125,30,104,32,142,42,90,156,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
