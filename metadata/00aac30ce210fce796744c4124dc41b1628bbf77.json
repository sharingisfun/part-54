The movie has not yet been released on DVD, so this is a capture from the airing.\n\nThis is in WMV format and this is the Portable version of the film. It&amp;#039;s picture size is half that of both Standard and HD variants of this movie and it&amp;#039;s just over 500 MBs, making it perfect for most PSPs and Ipods. (You may need to use PSPVideo9 to convert it to a format your PSP will recognize however..!!) All commercials have been removed and the movie re-spliced together to the best of my abilities using Windows Movie Maker. \n\nI&amp;#039;m working on DivX encoding now, and will offer up DivX encodings for people later once it&amp;#039;s done. \n\nUntil then, enjoy! ^______^ \t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00aac30ce210fce796744c4124dc41b1628bbf77","amp;dn":"Pokemon+Movie+10+-+The+Rise+of+Darkrai+%28Portable+Quality%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00aac30ce210fce796744c4124dc41b1628bbf77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,170,195,12,226,16,252,231,150,116,76,65,36,220,65,177,98,139,191,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
