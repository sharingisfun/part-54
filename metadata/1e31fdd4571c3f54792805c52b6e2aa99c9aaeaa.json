First published in 1971, the book is peppered \nthroughout with Milligan&amp;#039;s gags, one-liners and surreal comic invention. \nIndeed, many regard the memoirs as ranking with The Goon Show as his \ngreatest work.\n\nThe book has also been greatly admired for its portrayal of what life \nwas like for the ordinary British soldier during the War, and Milligan&amp;#039;s \ninsights are not only hilarious but also poignant and honest.\n\nPaul Merton&amp;#039;s delivery of the gags, characters and Goonish events of the \nstory vividly bring to life the experiences of the 22-year-old Milligan \nfrom call-up through basic training in the early years of the War.\n\nReader: Paul Merton\nProducer: Liz Anstee\nAbridged by Mike Haskins \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e31fdd4571c3f54792805c52b6e2aa99c9aaeaa","amp;dn":"Spike+Milligan+-+Adolf+Hitler+-+My+Part+In+His+Downfall","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e31fdd4571c3f54792805c52b6e2aa99c9aaeaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,49,253,212,87,28,63,84,121,40,5,197,43,110,42,169,156,154,174,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
