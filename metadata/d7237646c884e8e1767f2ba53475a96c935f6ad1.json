That?s the city they learned about musicians. As you hear from the style of the tracks they are pianists. With a little bit of Pac influence and other hip-hop symbols they decided to make music on their own. In 2002nd year Respect started their projects and they?ve got above 60 songs ?till this moment. In 2005th Respect establish studio/label called &quot;Respect Records&quot;. Many performers are recording to that studio and a lot of featurings were made. The subjects in the songs are various so everyone can find something to himself. Unfortunately the boys are still missing a producer for an Album but hey heads up. Here you can here absolutely free some of the songs. I hope and wish you to enjoy it. Thanks for every support you give and listen to the music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7237646c884e8e1767f2ba53475a96c935f6ad1","amp;dn":"Respect+Records+%28BG+Hip-hop%29+Full","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7237646c884e8e1767f2ba53475a96c935f6ad1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,35,118,70,200,132,232,225,118,127,43,165,52,117,169,108,147,95,106,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
