Thomas Gates, Ben&amp;#039;s great-grandfather, is mentioned in the page. It shows that Ben&amp;#039;s great-grandfather could have been involved with Abraham Lincoln&amp;#039;s murder. When doing more research, the conspiracy takes Ben, Abigail, and Riley to Buckingham Palace (which they break into).
