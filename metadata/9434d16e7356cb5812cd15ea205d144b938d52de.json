In the 1930s, while the adult Hellman (Jane Fonda) struggles to establish herself as a playwright with the help of her lover, Dashiell Hammett (Jason Robards), Julia (Vanessa Redgrave) battles the exigencies of the Nazi regime. Visiting Julia in Germany, Lillian realizes how much her friend&amp;#039;s idealism has cost her, both physically and financially. Lillian is asked by Julia&amp;#039;s friend Johann (Maximilian Schell) to smuggle a large sum of money from Paris to Germany, the better to combat the Nazis from within. Nominated for 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and four acting awards, Julia won for Alvin Sargent&amp;#039;s screenplay and Robards&amp;#039; and Redgrave&amp;#039;s performances, leading to Redgrave&amp;#039;s infamous &quot;Zionist hoodlums&quot; acceptance speech.\n\n\nJane Fonda \n- Lillian Hellman\nVanessa Redgrave \n- Julia\nJason Robards, Jr. \n- Dashiell Hammett\nMaximilian Schell \n- Johann\nHal Holbrook \n- Alan Campbell\nRosemary Murphy \n- Dorothy Parker\nMeryl Streep \n- Anne Marie\nDora Doll \n- Train Passenger\nElisabeth Mortensen \n- Train Passenger\nJohn Glover \n- Sammy\nLisa Pelikan \n- Young Julia\nSusan Jones \n- Young Lillian\nCathleen Nesbitt \n- Grandmother\nMaurice Denham \n- Undertaker\nGerard Buhr \n- Passport Officer\nEdmond Bernard \n- Man in Berlin Station\nAntony Carrick \n- Butler\nChristian de TiliÃƒÂ¨re \n- Paris Concierge\nStefan Gryff \n- Hamlet\nDon Koll \n- First-Nighter at Sardi&amp;#039;s\nMark Metcalf \n- Pratt\nAnn Queensbury \n- Woman in Berlin Station\nShane Rimmer \n- Customs Officer, New York Port Authority\nJacqueline Staup \n- Woman in Green Hat\nMolly Urquhart \n- Woman\nHans Verner \n- Vienna Concierge\n\nBest Actress (nom)\nJane Fonda \n1977\nAcademy\nBest Adapted Screenplay (win)\nAlvin Sargent \n1977\nAcademy\nBest Cinematography (nom)\nDouglas Slocombe \n1977\nAcademy\nBest Costume Design (nom)\nAnthea Sylbert \n1977\nAcademy\nBest Director (nom)\nFred Zinnemann \n1977\nAcademy\nBest Editing (nom)\nWalter Murch \n1977\nAcademy\nBest Original Score (nom)\nGeorges Delerue \n1977\nAcademy\nBest Picture (nom)\nRichard Roth \n1977\nAcademy\nBest Supporting Actor (nom)\nMaximilian Schell \n1977\nAcademy\nBest Supporting Actor (win)\nJason Robards, Jr. \n1977\nAcademy\nBest Supporting Actress (win)\nVanessa Redgrave \n1977\nAcademy\nBest Director (nom)\nFred Zinnemann \n1977\nDirectors Guild of America\nBest Actress - Drama (win)\nJane Fonda \n1977\nGolden Globe\nBest Director (nom)\nFred Zinnemann \n1977\nGolden Globe\nBest Picture - Drama (nom)\n \n1977\nGolden Globe\nBest Screenplay (nom)\nAlvin Sargent \n1977\nGolden Globe\nBest Supporting Actor (nom)\nJason Robards, Jr. \n1977\nGolden Globe\nBest Supporting Actor (nom)\nMaximilian Schell \n1977\nGolden Globe\nBest Supporting Actress (win)\nVanessa Redgrave \n1977\nGolden Globe\nBest Cinematography (win)\nDouglas Slocombe \n1977\nL.A.
