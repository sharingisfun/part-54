Always interested in blending jazz with folk and pop, the guitarist does just that, focusing heavily on the folk end of things on One Quiet Night. Featuring a nice afterglow interpretation of Norah Jones' hit &amp;quot;Don't Know Why&amp;quot; and an unexpected reinterpretation of &amp;quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&amp;quot; which turns the Gerry &amp;amp; the Pacemakers classic into a poignant lament, the album also showcases Metheny as a melodic pop composer. &amp;quot;Song for the Boys&amp;quot; sounds surprisingly like an instrumental take on early-'80s British pop ÃƒÂ  la the Smiths, while &amp;quot;Last Train Home&amp;quot; brilliantly mixes Metheny's knack for taking simple chord progressions and beautifully tweaking them with odd harmonies. Perhaps a bit light for some straight-ahead jazz fans, listeners interested in thoughtful, folky, jazz-inflected ballads will find this rapturous.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Allmusic.com\n\nTracks\n1.\t One Quiet Night\n 2.\t Song for the Boys\n 3.\t Don't Know Why\n 4.\t Another Chance\n 5.\t Time Goes On\n 6.\t My Song\n 7.\t Peace Memory\n 8.\t Ferry Cross the Mersey\n 9.\t Over on 4th Street\n 10.\t I Will Find the Way\n 11.\t North to South, East to West\n 12.\t Last Train Home\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\nReviews\t\n\t\t\nhttp://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00008YUEI/102-3621343-7500918?v=glance\n\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/music/jazz/reviews/metheny_quietnight.shtml\n\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?review_id=10842\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b0c4a8acc727a0dd2e1ae57211834330e40f1f8","amp;dn":"Pat+Metheny+-+One+Quiet+Night+%28APE+-+LOSSLESS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b0c4a8acc727a0dd2e1ae57211834330e40f1f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,12,74,138,204,114,122,13,210,225,174,87,33,24,52,51,14,64,241,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
