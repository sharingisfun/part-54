Paul Greendale.\n\n    Remix and additional production by Danny Howells.\n\n    Ashtrax&amp;#039;s first release for Deviant with only 4 acetates in circulation\n\n    being hammered by the likes of Sasha, John Digweed &amp; Danny Howells.\n\n    Tech edged house with a trippy backdrop against soft breakbeats, \n    quickly advances into a progressive frenzy.\n\n\n    &quot;Bushwacka - Net Bugz&quot;\n\n    Plank Records - AVTCD-95380 - 2000\n\n    Written by Matthew Benjamin.\n\n\n    Techie breaks number once featured in Distinct&amp;#039;ive&amp;#039;s Y3K Volume 2. Full \n    version taken off from the bonus disc only available in the Asian \n    version of the CD release.\n\n\n    &quot;Erasure - Rain (Blue Amazon Twisted Circles Mix)&quot;\n\n    Mute - CDLPMUTE208 - 1997\n    Written by Vince Clarke &amp; Andy Bell.\n\n    Remix and additional production by Lee Softley &amp; James Reid.\n\n\n    Another earlier piece of work from Blue Amazon. An epic house bassline \n    / squelchy synth workout, typical of the Huddersfield boys.\n\n\n    &quot;Every Little Thing - Deatta Koro No You Ni (Hybrid Remix)&quot;\n\n    Avex Inc. - AVCD-11680 - 1998\n\n    Produced by Mitsuru Igarashi.\n\n    Vocals by Kaori Mochida.\n\n    Remix and additional production by Hybrid.\n\n\n    One of the two only Japanese acts remixed by Hybrid (the other being \n    Ayumi Hamasaki). This mix sees them resetting everything to maximum \n    ethereality.\n\n\n    &quot;Every Little Thing - Time Goes By (Hybrid Remix)&quot;\n\n    Avex Inc. - AVCD-11680 - 1998\n\n    Produced by Mitsuru Igarashi.\n\n    Vocals by Kaori Mochida.\n\n    Remix and additional production by Hybrid.\n\n\n    The Swansea boys seem to like them much, this is a second remix scored \n    on one of ELT&amp;#039;s biggest hits. Straight on breaktrance with a sultry, \n    oriental sounding synth riff.\n\n\n    &quot;Evolution - Phoenix (Bill Hamel Remix)&quot;\n\n    Fluid Recordings - FLR 014 - 1999\n\n    Written by John Sutton &amp; Barry Jamieson.\n\n    Remix and additional production by Bill Hamel.\n\n\n    Fine piece of progressive house with an engaging bassline complemented \n    by a dubby percussive backdrop.\n\n\n    &quot;Kate Bush - Experiment IV (Hybrid Remix)&quot;\n\n    Capitol - 1986\n\n\n\n    Taken from &amp;#039;The Whole Story&amp;#039; release (Kate&amp;#039;s greatest hits/singles \n    album), Experiment IV was the only new song and the only single \n    released from it. This is the third featured remix by Hybrid.\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.hybrid-group.co.uk/discography.asp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.hybrid-group.co.uk/discography.asp&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n    &quot;The Black Dog ft Ofra Haza - Babylon (Terminalhead Tower Of Babel Mix)&quot;\n\n    Warner.esp - WESP006CD2 - 1998\n\n    Written by The Black Dog. (Black Dog Productions, Balil, Xeper, Plaid)\n\n    Remix and additional production by Terminalhead.\n\n\n    A piece of swirling aural soundscape from ambient/electronic trio\n\n    (Ken Downie, Ed Handley &amp; Andy Turner) featuring vocals from the late \n    Ofra Haza. This is the ferocious breaks remake provided by Bedrock&amp;#039;s \n    Star Bar residents, Lee Groves &amp; Pete Marett.\n\n\n:Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž:\n\n\n    DJMaSSiV:\n\n    &quot;Bocca Juniors - Substantially Soulful&quot;\n\n    Label: FFRR (BOIX 5)\n    Year: 1991\n\n    Written and Produced by Bocca Juniors\n\n    Bocca Juniors are Andy Weatherall, Terry Farley, Pete Heller, and Hugo \n    Nicholson. 3 Names should be familiar. Andy Weatherall went on to do \n    many remixes, including FSOL - Papua New Guinea, as well as become part \n    of &quot;Sabres of Paradise&quot;. Terry Farley has always been a house icon, and \n    Pete Heller has recently pioneered the latest tribal/tech-house genre \n    with his unique styles of house. This track is a beautiful downtempo \n    blend of funk and vocal house.\n\n\n    &quot;Dream 2 Science - My Love Turns To Liquid (Beat Foundation Mix)&quot;\n\n    Label: Confusion Records (CON 51)\n    Year: 1995\n\n    Written by M.B. Cenac, Produced by Ben Cenac. Remix and Additional \n    Production by Beat Foundation\n\n    Beat Foundation with another excellent remix of a great ambient vocal \n    track. A building progression of melodic synths with heavenly vocals, \n    and various mellow guitar samples (yes, I said guitar!). A great, \n    sultry end of night track for the moody folk...\n\n\n    &quot;F.P.I. Project - Come On And Do It (Mothers At Work Mix)&quot;\n\n    Label: IT/Synthetic Records (SYNTH 006)\n    Year: 1993\n\n    Written by Frattini/Foresti/Biffi/Bericchia/Aalgaard. Produced and \n    Mixed by L. Berry/M. Fratty/R. Intrallazzi/C. Presti. Remixed by Lee \n    Fisher and Jools for Mother Productions\n\n    Mother, known for their remixes and productions, such as &quot;All Funked Up&quot;, \n    putting their trademark funky twist on italian producers F.P.I. Project \n    (&quot;Rich in Paradise&quot;). More great house beats combined with great funky \n    bass riffs, synth, and sax runs! This one was always a floorfiller :)\n\n\n    &quot;Love Corporation - Palatial II&quot;\n\n    Label: Creation (CRE 76T)\n    Year: 1990\n\n    Produced and Remixed by Doug Martin\n\n    Palatial is an alltime favorite of mine. One of the first in its class \n    with beautiful synth riffs and melodic piano driven by a house beat. \n    The sound of early Ibiza with a self-hypnotic chant shifting in and out \n    of the track. A true classic progressive track in every sense.\n\n\n    &quot;Midirain - Always (Demented Mix 2)&quot;\n\n    Label: Vinyl Solution (STORM 37R)\n    Year: 1991\n\n    Written and Produced by John Rocca\n\n    Midirain did some very interesting tracks in this time frame, this one, \n    which to me, paved the way for intelligent breaks artists such as \n    Starecase and RITM. It is a unique collage of ambient and swirling \n    synths over a techno/breaks beat with vocal bits riding the melody. \n\n\n    &quot;My Friend Sam feat Viola Wills - Its My Pleasure (Debo&amp;#039;s Sub Dub)&quot;\n\n    Label: White (MW04)\n    Year: 1998\n\n    Written and Produced by My Friend Sam\n    Additional Remix and Production by John Debo\n\n    Boston&amp;#039;s own John Debo with a slammin&amp;#039; remix of this classic track, \n    which only saw its way to a few white label promos. Very much in demand. \n    Hope you all enjoy it :)\n\n\n    &quot;The Mephisto Odyssey - Dream Of The Black Dahlia (Freaky Chakra Mix)&quot;\n\n    Label: Mephisto Records \n    Year: 1994\n\n    Written and Produced by Mikael Johnston &amp; Orpheus Anthony Dejournette\n\n    California Duo, The Mephisto Odyssey with a chuggin&amp;#039; remix of their \n    classic by Freaky Chakra. The original was a jazz breaks fusion that \n    was a modification of current acid jazz sounds, which brought forth \n    what we now know as &quot;West Coast Breaks&quot;. Freaky Chakra throws some \n    serious acid funk into the mix, which transforms the track into a \n    fiendishly unusual progressive monster.  \n\n\n    &quot;Visions - Is This Real (Ouverture Breakbeat Mix)&quot;\n\n    Label: Flying Records (FLY 142)\n    Year: 1992\n\n    Written and Produced by Magic Juan Atkins with Additional Production by \n    Fresh &amp;#039;N&amp;#039; Funk.\n\n    Detroit househead Juan Atkins makes a serious house classic at the time \n    the Detroit Underground scene continued its reign from the late 80s (in \n    the 90s the UK took over :P). Detroit has its roots in the Underground \n    house scene with the acid house and techno genres. This track is a \n    mixture of vocal house, freestyle, and  breaks elements.\n\n\n:Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž:\n\n\n    Spooky &amp; The Four Horsemen Of The Progopolypse:\n\n    &quot;Dido - Take My Hand (Collins And Dunne 21 Mix)&quot;\n\n    Excellent exclusive remix!\n\n\n    &quot;Highland - No Way Out (Original Edit)&quot;\n\n    Nice, nice, nice!\n\n\n    &quot;Paul De Aragon - Silent Skies&quot;\n\n    Year: 1997\n    Label: Jackpot\n\n    Paul De Aragon was a pioneering producer on the Jackpot label, \n    responsible for a series of tracks such as Ritual, Anima, and this one, \n    Silent Skies in addition to remixes for the likes of Aria, Jan Johnston \n    and Danny Campbell. John Digweed was a huge fan of this guy&amp;#039;s work, \n    featuring Anima and Silent Skies on the 1997  Jackpot album Winning \n    Ticket. The track itselt is a classic slice of progressive &amp;#039;t&amp;#039;rance with \n    its powerful bassline and tight production. However, 4 years later we \n    find Paul in hiding as Junky, a mainstay within the tronik discussion \n    channel, and always quick to give an opinion the state of the scene when \n    all he&amp;#039;s doing is sitting on his backside, and trying to make Digital \n    Audio rips of KissFM sets sound better by adding &amp;#039;production effects&amp;#039; to \n    them. Hopefully he will redeem himself with his work alongside Paolo \n    Mojo on a remix of Bedrock&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Forge&amp;#039;. We can only hope as maybe we&amp;#039;ll \n    get some peace and quiet if this happens.\n\n\n    &quot;Nebulus VS DJ Style - Why Do Things Break?&quot;\n\n    Year: 2001\n    Ripper: The Four Horsemen Of The Progopolypse\n    Label: N/A\n\n    Nebulus are Paul Determan and Ben Gorske, who produce under many other \n    aliases such as Marscruiser, and with a third production  partner called \n    Jason Dunne as PB &amp; J. With two singles on Fire Recordings and a track, \n    Blueless featured on the latest Renaissance album, Revelation, their \n    star is truely rising. This is a new production from them that gets its \n    world premiere thanks to the leading underground music suppliers that \n    are Tronik.\n\n\n    &quot;Solid Sessions - Janeiro (Chiller Twist Blue Line Mix)&quot;\n\n    Year: 2001\n    Label: Combined Forces\n\n    Janeiro was initially released on Combined Forces back in 2000, but was \n    picked up for UK release by Additive who comissioned new remixes, two \n    of which found their way onto Jimmy Van M&amp;#039;s Bedrock album, and suddenly \n    everyone was on this track. A subtle downtempo progressive house cut \n    that just shimmers and slides through a series of key changes. Now \n    Combined Forces have comissioned some lounge mixes including one from \n    the superb producer Chiller Twist who has been one of the rising stars \n    of 2001, with many unique twists placed on a number of mainstream \n    tracks, as well as his own productions and album &amp;#039;The Way&amp;#039; finding \n    favour with many top progressive djs. Enjoy this blissed out production, \n    and take time to reflect on the year that was 2001.\n\n\n    &quot;origin - Refined Intricacy (Ambient Mix)&quot;\n\n    Year: 2001\n    Label: Renaissance Recordings\n\n    Origin are Anthony Mein and Dave Wood, label bosses of Steel Yard \n    Recordings and responsible for the massive tracks &amp;#039;Wide Eyed Angel&amp;#039; and \n    this track, Refined Intricacy which was dusted off and re-released this \n    year alongside a new track, Rage. This ambient mix was not officially \n    released, and is a piano driven downtempo interpretation of what has \n    been a classic track for many years.\n\n\n:Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž:\n\n\n    KostiX:\n\n    &quot;Sunday Club - Paladian Dawn (Edge Factor Mix)&quot;\n\n    Remix and additional production by Markus Schulz &amp; C.I. McSpadden for \n    Plastik Productions. Written by Marc Mitchell &amp; Stuart King. Published \n    by Mix Music (UK) LTD. P1997 Stress Records (12STR77)\n\n    A very nice classic piece of progressive housey trance, which I am \n    pretty lucky to have on 12&quot;, as Stress Records no longer exists and \n    there wasnt too many copies made. Dont hesitate to listen to the \n    original version, which is a total master piece, by 2 of the best \n    producers, Marc Mitchell &amp; Stuart King. Initially released on Stress \n    Records in 1995. Now you can find it on \n    Sunday_Club_-_Remixes_And_Productions-Promo-2001-tronik, a great \n    collection of classics for the exclusive Sunday Club fans.\n\n\n    &quot;Innerself - Alive (Starecase Remix)&quot;\n\n    Remix and additional production by Starecase (aka Paul Damian and Al \n    Watson). P1997 Stress Records (12STR93)\n\n    Classic trance piece, remixed by the Starecase guys in their earlier \n    fashion. Ambiental background and a lot of colorufully beautiful \n    landscapes, which surely used to bang many dancefloors all around the \n    world. Hope you enjoy these 2 classics as much as I do !

JDS (aka Darren Pearce \n    and Julian Napolitano, who made waves in 1997 with Nine Ways) remixed \n    it in fine trance-breaks style that was coming into vogue around that \n    time. The remix is as remote from the awfully cheesy original as \n    possible - it starts all sinister and dark with tweaked vocal samples, \n    then it goes into frantic acidic trance, then breakdown, then sparse \n    breaks, then energetic dancefloor mayhem again and then the melodic \n    ending. This is one of the remixes that converted me to the so-popular \n    today progressive breakbeat genre. Legend also has it that due to \n    aggressive promotional push for this second Quicksilver UK single, \n    with posters and stands at music store entrances screaming &quot;FREE&quot;, \n    unaware shoppers would come into stores, grab the cd single and walk \n    out without paying for it. Concerned store owners took down all \n    slogans, moved the single from the front stands to the back and as a \n    result it didn&amp;#039;t quite become the chart hit everyone expected it to be. \n    Fortunately for all of us, DJ Quicksilver&amp;#039;s career went rapidly \n    downhill from that point forward.\n\n\n    &quot;E-N - That Sound (Edge Factor Dub)&quot;\n\n    1996 SFP Records SFP9609\n    Produced by Ian Appel, vocals by Clara Vox.\n    Remix &amp; additional production by Markus Schulz &amp; CL McSpadden.\n\n    This is possibly my favourite Edge Factor remix. The song is by one \n    Ian Appel featuring a certain Ceevox and was originally released by \n    Florida-based SFP label in 1996. The Edge Factor Dub largely eliminates \n    the vocals and only leaves some nonsensical but anthemic whoa-ooh-aah \n    screams and snippets. It is also regarded as the best of all mixes \n    commissioned for this track (and there have been quite a few). This \n    track still sounds fantastic today and makes my heart skip a beat every \n    time I hear it.\n\n\n    &quot;House Of 909 - Main Event (16B Remix)&quot;\n\n    1998 Pagan Records DPRO-61868 30027 2 5\n    Remix &amp; additional production by Omid Nourizadeh.\n\n    One of the early Omid&amp;#039;s remixes in this guise, this is a deep house \n    reinterpretation of an already deep house track by the Pagan Records \n    outfit House Of 909. Very laidback.\n\n\n    &quot;House Of Zekkariyas - Secret Star (Sasha&amp;#039;s A Mix)&quot;\n\n    1994 WEA/Warner Bros WO222CD\n    Directed by The House Of Zekkariyas.\n    Remixed by Sasha &amp; Tom Frederickse for 7PM, programming by Gaetan \n    Schurrer.\n\n    House Of Zekkariyas are in fact Womack &amp; Womack, who may be best known \n    for their massive hit &quot;Teardrops&quot;. This is one of the early classic \n    Sasha remixes and is representative of the trademark Qat Collection \n    sound of that time.\n\n\n    &quot;James Holden - Kaern&quot;\n\n    2000 Silver Planet. Taken from CHILLBABY03CD1.\n    Written &amp; produced by James Holden.\n\n    Not something we are typically used to from Mr. Holden, this is a \n    five-minute long beautiful ambient chill-out piece. As James Holden \n    himself pointed out, it also happens to be his personal favourite \n    creation. It never really got a proper release and was only featured on \n    an obscure dodgy mixed chillout comp and in a reworked form on JH&amp;#039;s \n    own &quot;Fear Of A Silver Planet&quot; mix CD. Here it is in it&amp;#039;s full length \n    unmixed glory.\n\n\n    &quot;JC - So Hot&quot;\n\n    1998 EastWestDance EW146CD\n    Written and produced by Jonathan Davis.\n\n    JC is (or was) part of the Tour De Force production combo, who are most \n    famous for Alright, Secrets Of Logic  and some of their remixes. While \n    the Tour De Force stuff is not exactly my cup of tea this track is \n    something different. More downbeat, more underground, more melodic and \n    more serene, the ethnic wailing adding to the charm. The track was \n    noted and was charted by all the usual suspects when it first came out. \n    Perfect for blissful dreamy moments.\n\n\n    &quot;Konya - Come On (Forth Coded Dub)&quot;\n\n    1996 Positiva 7243 8 71060 2 4 (promo CD)\n    Written by Alex Gioia &amp; Peter Zollo.\n    Remixed by Forth for Deep Level Productions.\n\n    I don&amp;#039;t know anything about Konya and I doubt that I ever will want to. \n    The original is typical Italo Posicheesa, but the dub by GU resident \n    Forth rescues it by leaving snippets of the Come On moaning. Altogether, \n    it&amp;#039;s a pumping energetic trance track perfectly executed by Forth, as \n    usual.\n\n\n    &quot;Madagascar - You&amp;#039;re Beautiful (JCB Remix)&quot;\n\n    1998 Coda Productions / ZYX  ZYX8897-8\n    Written &amp; Produced by Mike Cosford &amp; Luke Stidworthy.\n\n    Club-friendly quasi-breakbeat tune that was featured on Nick Warrens \n    Brazil GU which showcased the genre. Mike Cosford (aka JCB), owner of \n    the Coda label took the rather poptastic original and remixed it for \n    additional credibility.\n\n\n    &quot;Moby - That&amp;#039;s When I Reach For My Revolver (Rollo &amp; Sister Bliss Vocal \n    Mix)&quot;\n\n    1996 Mute Records LCDMute184\n    Written by C.Conley.\n    Produced, mixed &amp; engineered by Alan Moulder &amp; Moby.\n    Remixed by Rollo &amp; Sister Bliss.\n\n    I have been a big fan of Rollo &amp; Sister Bliss ever since 1995, they \n    could take a good pop song and turn it into a massive club choon without \n    cheesing it up (too much). Faithless were little known back then, but \n    remix-wise the pair was all over the shop, even adding their touch to \n    one of the biggest selling singles of 1995 &quot;Fairground&quot;. This is the \n    ultimate, my favourite remix by them and one of my all-time favourites \n    altogether. Rollo &amp; Bliss take the rather bland Moby original (he was \n    going through his punk metal rock stage at the time), add drama to it \n    and turn it into hypnotic dancefloor mayhem. The breakdown sends shivers \n    down my spine and even Moby&amp;#039;s whiney vocals seem fitting.\n\n\n    &quot;Outlander - The Vamp (Frank De Wulf Remix)&quot;\n\n    1997 R&amp;S Records RS97113CD\n    Written &amp; Produced by Marcos Salon.\n\n    Classic techno tune released originally in 1991 on R&amp;S. The track was \n    re-released in 1997 with new club mixes and I especially liked the \n    remix by another R&amp;S stablemate Frank De Wulf, who has also remixed the \n    likes of Erasure, N-Joy, Jam &amp; Spoon, The Orb and The Shamen.\n\n\n    &quot;Parks &amp; Wilson - Let The Music Lift You Up (Dancefloor Demolition Mix)&quot;\n\n    1994 Stress Records STRSCD3\n    Written by Parks/Wilson/Banks/Watkins.\n    Produced by Mike Parks/Mick Wilson, vocals licensed from KMS/Network.\n\n    One of the early Parks &amp; Wilson productions, when they were part of DMC \n    Production. This track was on the ultra-rare Club Land EP (Original \n    Bootleg Mixes) on Stress and this mix also appears on the Club Culture \n    compilation released in 1993. Classic early-Renaissance era stuff with \n    obligatory female diva vocals.\n\n\n    &quot;Paula Cole - Where Have All The Cowboys Gone (Dekkard&amp;#039;s Ranco Pepe Mix)&quot;\n\n    1996 Warner Bros Records 9 43854-2\n    Written and producded by Paula Cole.\n    Additional remix &amp; production by Dekkard for MCT.\n\n    One-time Sasha &amp; BT collaborator (he engineered Sasha&amp;#039;s remixes of such \n    seminal classics as Direct Me, Embracing The Sunshine, I&amp;#039;m Alive, etc.) \n    Rich Dekkard remixes folksy-rocksy Paula Cole and I think this is one \n    of his best remixes ever. Where Have All The Cowboys Gone is one of \n    those female manifesto songs that ruled the US airwaves a few years ago \n    (AOR format, I forget what it means - album-oriented-rock or adult-\n    oriented-rock, in other words pretty dull and grown-up); Dekkard takes \n    the best of the vocals and makes a haunting piece of music out of it. \n    This was the peak of epic house and all his production techniques he has\n    lent over to Sasha and BT are very obvious here, in fact you would be \n    forgiven for thinking that this is one of the finest BT or Sasha moments, \n    so similar is the sound. If anyone wants to read more about Rich Dekkard \n    I would recommend to them an interview Dave Dresden did in July of 1997, \n    which contains Dekkard&amp;#039;s thoughts on working with Sasha and BT in the \n    studio.\n\n\n    &quot;Presence - Better Days (Salt City Orchestra Better Mix)&quot;\n\n    1998 Pagan Records DPRO-61868 30027 2 5\n    Written by Charles Webster &amp; Delroy St. Joseph. Produced by Charles \n    Webster.\n    Remix &amp; additional production by Si Brad, Miles Hollway &amp; Elliot \n    Eastwick.\n\n    Presence is of course Charles Webster (aka Love From San Francisco, aka \n    Furry Phreaks), yet another deep house signing of Pagan. Salt City \n    Orchestra were also signed to Pagan at that time (along with Paper) and \n    were asked to make a remix. This is basically a marriage made in heaven \n    - SCO take a soulful deep track and add this distinguished UK house \n    touch to it. It remains faithful to the original yet injects major \n    funkiness that made Salt City Orchestra so brilliant.\n\n\n    &quot;Sasha - Arkham Asylum / Ohmna&quot;\n\n    1996 Deconstruction / BMG 74321 434022\n    All tracks written &amp; produced by Alexander Coe.\n\n    Two-track single, this official follow-up to Be As One is probably my \n    favourite Sasha production (amusingly enough, none of the studio \n    engineers are credited on the single this time). A distinctive departure \n    from the earlier sound (probably due to the end of his partnership with \n    Rich Dekkard), both are largely instrumental and have a darker, deeper \n    feel to them. The track length is also as epic as it gets  - Ohmna, \n    being the longer one by clocking in over 14 minutes. The release story \n    is rather strange... Concerned by rampant bootlegging of the previous \n    single Be As One this release was shrouded in secrecy and hardly any \n    promos were sent out the the DJ&amp;#039;s, in fact many of them got their copies \n    with the formal commercial release. As a result, it didn&amp;#039;t get enough \n    play and performed rather poorly chart-wise (the fact that the total \n    play time did not conform to the UK chart restrictions didn&amp;#039;t help \n    either). IMHO the tracks did not get the attention they deserved, which \n    is a shame as both tracks are brilliant. Arkham Asylum is of course the \n    name of the Gotham mental institution in the Batman comics and it is \n    possible that Tim Burton&amp;#039;s dark vision and imagery may have contributed \n    to the concept of the track. I don&amp;#039;t have a clue as to what Ohmna means.\n\n\n    &quot;Sueno Latino - Sueno Latino&quot;\n\n    1997 Distinctive Records DISNCD32\n    Written by M.Gottsching/R.Persi/A.Gemolotto/C.Collino\n    Love From San Francisco Remix 07:51\n    Remix &amp; additional production by Charles Webster.\n    Salt Tank Amnesian Remix 10:07\n    Remix &amp; additional production by 4 Real Communications courtesy of FFRR.\n\n    And next is Charles Webster himself remixing the seminal Sueno Latino \n    track. It&amp;#039;s a trippy, downtempo affair with cool effects and noises. \n    Definitely one for those quiet chillout afternoon moments. Salt Tank \n    deliver a decidedly different mix, anthemic and uplifting. All the Salt \n    Tank trademarks are there, the tune is energetic and beefed up, yet \n    stays true to the melodic base of the original. Both are a part of the \n    1997 re-release.\n\n\n    &quot;The Disco Evangelists - De Niro (The Spaceflight Remix)&quot;\n\n    1993 Positiva CDTIV-2\n    Written by Holmes/Beedle/Edwards.\n    Produced and arranged by Daddy Ash and David Holmes, co-produced by \n    Lindsay Edwards.\n\n    Ah, the tune of all tunes. One of the very first Positiva releases, this \n    track was featured on just about every classic or retrospective \n    progressive house compilation, including the notorious Renaissance One. \n    The Disco Evangelists are in fact David Holmes, Ashley Beedle and \n    Lindsay Edwards. The track samples the famous Ennio Morricone melody \n    (I guess that&amp;#039;s the origin of the track name - composer of the score for \n    one of the most popular Italian-American mafia movies ever, young \n    starring actor, you link up the rest yourself) and also  - as the rumour \n    has it - the sounds of helicopters from Apocalypse Now. One of the most \n    anthemic, uplifting house tracks ever.\n\n\n:Ãƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€žÃƒâ€ž:\n\n\n    Altern-8:\n\n    &quot;Black Girl Rock - The Theme&quot;\n\n    Year: 1992\n    Produced by J Petrie/T.O&amp;#039;Riordan\n\n    Another classic of old that represented the progression from hardcore/\n    rave to more subtle, laidback grooves.  This one features a catchy \n    chorus w/ divas galore. ;)\n\n\n    &quot;Delerium - Incantation (Extended Mix)&quot;\n\n    Year: 1994\n    Produced by Bill Leeb &amp; Rhys Fulber w/ Greg Reely\n\n    The now infamous Delerium (&quot;Innocente,&quot; &quot;Silence,&quot; etc.) features on \n    1,000 w/ a little known track titled &quot;Incantation,&quot; featuring the vocal \n    talents of Kristy Thirsk (who has sung vocals for Delerium many times\n    since this release)...this is a very clubby offering from the Delerium \n    camp, yet it retains many of the elements that Delerium are known for \n    including the ethnic samples and epic synths.\n\n\n    &quot;Interface - Is What You&amp;#039;re Doing Right (Family Groove)&quot;\n\n    Year: 1994\n    Produced by Rod Stone &amp; Martin Baird. Vocals by Rod Stone. Guitar by \n    Stephen Johnson.  All songs written by Rod Stone &amp; Stephen Johnson.\n    Remixed by Robert Taylor, Arnold Velasco, &amp; Martin Baird\n\n    An EP featuring the vocal talents of Rod Stone. Straight out of Dallas, \n    TX, this overlooked act offers some quality synth-based vocal pop with \n    more underground club mixes like this one, the Family Groove. It&amp;#039;s \n    remixed by Dallas, TX DJ legends who have entertained &amp; represented \n    Dallas for over a decade: Robert Taylor &amp; Arnold Velasco (DJ A1).\n\n\n    &quot;Kimball And Dekkard - Hardlife (Original) / Lushlife (Original)&quot;\n\n    Just to give you an idea of the sound of the US underground music\n    back in the old days.\n\n\n    &quot;Little wing - Mercy Mercy&quot;\n\n    Year: 1996\n    Produced by Robbie &amp; Gavin Hardkiss. Recorded by Jeff Gray Live \n    Percussion - Jose Najera\n\n    A chilled out sun-drenched downtempo affair that offers a welcomed \n    change in style to all my other offerings.\n\n\n    &quot;Soul Odyssey - Rapture&quot;\n\n    Year: 1993\n\n    Produced by Rob Vaughan &amp; Josh Kay\n\n    Early uplifting progressive house straight out of Dallas, Texas...the likes,\n    of which has rarely been repeated.  Josh Kay later moved to Florida and\n    became Soul Oddity and Phoenicia, and founded the Schematics label.\n    Wicked tune.\n\n\n    &quot;The Mighty Dub Kats - Only When I&amp;#039;m Dancing Do I Feel This Disco&quot;\n\n    Year: 1995\n\n    Norman Cook at it once again, this time successfully sampling Madonna. \n    A mid-90&amp;#039;s disco-house romp not meant to be taken seriously.\n\n\n    &quot;Transformer 2 - Pacific Symphony&quot;\n\n    Year: 1992\n\n    A sun-drenched techno classic in every sense of the word.  It&amp;#039;s not \n    clear as to whom is behind this early melodic trancer, but whomever \n    they are, they struck a chord w/ the clubbers of this era. Soothing \n    pads, piano, a strong kick, vocal &amp; nature samples and even the \n    whistle posse in full effect, this represented the beginning of a new\n    era...a veering away from the hardcore rave sounds into the more \n    subtle progressive house/trance sounds championed by Guerilla in the \n    coming years.\n\n\n    &quot;Way Out West - Mindcircus (WOW Club Mix 2)&quot;\n\n    Year: 2001\n\n    An unreleased WOW Club Mix (scene or otherwise) of WOW&amp;#039;s forthcoming \n    single &quot;Mindcircus,&quot; sure to be a hit in club-land and elsewhere.  \n\n\n    &quot;Josh Wink - Feeling Good (Funky Elevation Remix)&quot;\n\n    Year: 1994\n    Written, Produced &amp; grooved by Josh Wink\n\n    One of the earliest Josh Wink releases under his prior pseudonym, \n    Winx...this is a deep acidic breakbeat affair that builds to a 4/4 \n    house rhythm with a spacious and subtle melody.\n\n\n    &quot;Yum Yum Head Food - Bird Of Prey&quot;\n\n    Year: 1995\n\n    This is Fatboy Slim (aka Norman Cook) in disguise... and is basically \n    &quot;Sunset&quot; before it was commercialized just last year.

Their classy remix \n    of one of everyone&amp;#039;s favorites, &quot;Perfect Motion&quot; is further testament to \n    that. While being called the Vocal mix, it actually uses a minimum of \n    the vocals, but repeats them beautifully, even adding some porn horns in \n    the lovely breakdown.  This one is right up there with the Boys Own \n    Remix, and near the Sunday Club Mix.  Be sure to check out a possible \n    upcoming update of this CLASSIC track by current TOO HOT TO HANDLE, Way \n    out West, whose recent remixes have been Fucking fantastic...

Remix and additional \n    production by Andy Ling/Barry Jamieson/Jonothon Sutton at The Parachute \n    Studios, Manchester.\n\n    Reprise/Warner Music UK (9 43878-2)\n    Year: 1997\n\n    This remix came out after Andy&amp;#039;s triumph in conquering the progressive\n    breaks world with his first production With Evolution called &quot;Calling \n    Angels,&quot; a tune that caught the attention of Sasha and other world \n    leading DJs. His discography goes back to 1996 and he is definitely not \n    a newbie in the progressive scene. The new single by this man entitled \n    &quot;Futura&quot; is expected to be out sometime in December 2001. Changing the \n    sonic direction, this remarkably talented artist has produced a fun,\n    quirky &amp; cool housey sound that&amp;#039;s set to be his next landmark, \n    illustrating what he does at best.\n\n\n    &quot;ATT - Warrior Groove&quot;\n\n    Creative Music (CREATIVE 011)\n    Year: 2001\n\n    Circulation&amp;#039;s label just keeps the tracks pounding out with excellent\n    deep house sounds that definitely go for that big room vibe. This tune\n    is just one example of nice output from Creative Music. Definitely\n    got big plays from Peace Division, 16B, Slacker, etc.\n\n\n    &quot;DJ Chris Harshman presents CK-NY - Fortys On Ice (Pako &amp; Frederik&amp;#039;s \n    Majestic Mix)&quot;\n\n    Written and produced by Chris Harshman and Konrad Carelli at Bass N&amp;#039; \n    Treble Studio. Remixed by Pako &amp; Frederik.\n\n    Nervous Dog Records (ND 20332B)\n    Year: 1998\n\n    Ah yes, these two Dutch producers have been messing with music gears\n    long enough. Their sounds are not hard to recognize as most have some\n    funky and chunky beat with tight drums and a swirling melody that \n    sticks in your head, not to mention the druggy effects and their\n    sometimes called &amp;#039;boring repetition sounds.&amp;#039; Are they working on an \n    artist album? I guess we&amp;#039;ll find out soon. Respect the Majestic duo!\n\n\n    &quot;Drum Club - Alchemy (Orbital&amp;#039;s Phasers On Stun Mix)&quot;\n\n    Written by C.Hall/L.Hammond (NTV Music). Recorded at Butterfly Studios, \n    London. Remix and additional production by Orbital. Remixed at the \n    Strongroom.\n\n    Guerilla Records\n    Year: 1991\n\n    I guess this Orbital rework of Drum Club is the best mix I&amp;#039;ve heard\n    from them. One of my all-time fav tunes.\n\n\n    &quot;Hong Kong Trash - Skuzzlebutt (Hong Kong Trash)&quot;\n\n    Glow Records (GLOW10)\n    Year: 1998\n\n    Why would an artist pick a lousy name such as this one? Ok, just think \n    of Glow Records that have flooded the market with some amazing \n    productions and remixes. This record used to be a sure fire underground \n    hit with its support and the funkiness of the groove.\n\n\n    &quot;Jayn Hanna - River Of Tears (Evolution Dub Mix)&quot;\n\n    Written by Jayn Hanna/Barry Jamieson/Jonothon Sutton at The Parachute, \n    Manchester. Guitar and Bass by Dan McBean. Published by Deconstruction \n    Songs (BMG). Remixed by Evolution (Barry Jamieson &amp; Jonothon Sutton)\n\n    VC Recordings (VCRTDJ51)\n    Year: 1999\n\n    This is the follow up to the classic &quot;Lost Without You&quot; by Fluid \n    Recordings&amp;#039; head honchos who&amp;#039;ve been doing the business with their \n    unique &amp; ever changing sounds &amp; slick production. A big downer to many\n    fans, this tune never saw the light of the day (It&amp;#039;s got some good\n    parts though). As rare as any other most valuable records you could \n    name, this one is worth shitload of $$$ if you ever saw it floating on \n    some auction sites. It&amp;#039;s good to hear the fantastic new Jayn Hanna \n    single that has been given remix treatment by the Bedrockers. &quot;Walking \n    On Fire&quot; got that tribal undertone that&amp;#039;s caused a lot buzz in the \n    progressive house arena as it immediately smashes its way through many \n    dj sets and works 10/10 in &quot;deep sounds with progressive elements&quot; \n    department. Well, it&amp;#039;s very tribal influenced in parts, much in keeping \n    with the current club sound &amp; very much unlike its predecessors.\n\n\n    &quot;Kalyx - The Coming&quot;\n\n    Written and produced by Chris Fortier and Neil Kolo (Orlando, USA) for \n    Fade Conviction Management\n\n    Journey Records (Journey 010)\n    Year: 1998\n\n    Ah, you can&amp;#039;t miss this one. A nice retro compilation has to have a tune\n    from an outfit that&amp;#039;s been shaping the underground sound long enough. \n    Produced by Fade, this tune is much more of a trancey affair that has \n    all the killer cosmic grooves with a spacey programmed stomper.\n\n\n    &quot;New Horizon - Feel So Right (Darren Glen&amp;#039;s &quot;Break Of Dawn&quot; Remix)&quot;\n\n    Written &amp; produced by Darren Glen &amp; Andy J for Jupiter Productions. \n    Vocals by Sue Jones\n\n    Vicious Vinyl (VV12038)\n    Year: 1999\n\n    Yum! This is a good remix from Darren Glen. An Aussie artist? Oh, it\n    really rocks.\n\n\n    &quot;Orientalist - Tron (Lemon 8 &quot;Inner Sanctuary&quot; Mix)&quot;\n\n    Source Records\n    Year: 2000\n\n    A pretty good kicking-ass action from Harry Lemon who apparently made\n    the best remix of the original that was supported heavily by Armin\n    *cough cough* Van Bureen.\n\n\n    &quot;Qattara - Peace &amp; Mind (Mix 1)&quot;\n\n    Written &amp; produced by Alex Whitcombe &amp; Mike Marshall. Published by Steel \n    Fish Publishing.\n\n    Steelfish Blue (SFB 002)\n    Year: 1999\n\n    Ok, I&amp;#039;m thinking this piece is like a noise generator. I don&amp;#039;t always \n    like all of their stuffs, but they&amp;#039;ve done their share of classics (the\n    yummy &quot;Come With Me&quot;).\n\n\n    &quot;Stef, Pako &amp; Frederik - Seaside Atmosphere (Evolution&amp;#039;s Ambient \n    Seagull)&quot;\n\n    Written &amp; produced by S.Raisani. Remix &amp; additional production by \n    Evolution.\n\n    Coded (CODE003)\n    Year: 1999\n\n    This is probably one of the best mixes by the Manchester old skool duo. \n    I&amp;#039;m very big on this absolute beauty. Compared with the 17+ min long \n    Original Mix, this one wins by a long shot. Ambient lovers would be \n    impressed at the creativity of this project as this is not your average \n    chill out group. \n\n\n    &quot;Surreal - Happiness (Fathers Of Sound Renaissance Mix)&quot;\n\n    Produced by Kevin Saunderson and Tommy Onyx. Remixed by Fathers Of Sound.\n\n    Whitelake (Surreal1)\n    Year: 1996\n\n    This is taken from 2x12&quot; Ibiza Edition that features 4 Fathers Of Sound\n    Mixes and 2 Reese In Paradise Mixes.\n\n\n    &quot;The Human League - Stay With Me Tonight (The Biff &amp; Memphis Remix)&quot;\n\n    Written by Oakey/Stanley.
