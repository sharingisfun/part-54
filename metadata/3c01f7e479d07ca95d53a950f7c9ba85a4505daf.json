With twenty-five years of &quot;help&quot; from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank intended to bring Third World nations such as Jamaica into the fold of free market economies, these restructuring&quot; policies have crippled Jamaica's efforts towards self-reliant development while enriching the lenders. This scathing film is an unapologetic look at the &quot;new world order&quot; from the point of view of Jamaican workers and farmers, as well as government and policy officials. Featuring a dynamic reggae soundtrack and a searing voice over based on text by Jamaica Kincaid, as well as interviews with former Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manly, Deputy Director of the IMF Stanley Fisher and President of Haiti Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Life and Debt portrays the relationship between Jamaican poverty and the practices of the international lending agencies while driving home the devastating \nconsequences of globalization.\n\nenjoy, and look for more great infofallout releases really soon ;)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c01f7e479d07ca95d53a950f7c9ba85a4505daf","amp;dn":"Life+and+Debt+documentary+dvdrip-+INFOFALLOUT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c01f7e479d07ca95d53a950f7c9ba85a4505daf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,1,247,228,121,208,124,169,93,83,169,80,247,201,186,133,164,80,93,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
