The sound was a return to the style of Anticipation and No Secrets after years of following trends ? the songs were romantic, with the erotic edge that had charged much of Simon&amp;#039;s best material. The album was typically uneven, but also typically personal and compelling. The title track was a winning account of her parents&amp;#039; courting, complete with a happy-ever-after ending that didn&amp;#039;t occur in real life. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e87e78757ee736a827848330327866f9aeaa8fa","amp;dn":"Carly+Simon+-+Hello+Big+Man+%28+1983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e87e78757ee736a827848330327866f9aeaa8fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,135,231,135,87,238,115,106,130,120,72,51,3,39,134,111,154,234,168,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
