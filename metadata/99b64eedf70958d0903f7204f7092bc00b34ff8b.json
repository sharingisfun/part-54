Rather than a bunch of random riding thrown together with music, the producers of 6IX have stepped up to offer a docutainment-style film that closely profiles six of the sportÃƒÂ¢??s top athletes. 6IX brings viewers a unique look at high-profile riders Davi Millsaps, Kevin Windham, Ryan Villopoto, Billy Laninovich, Twitch, and Mike Mason as they go through the trials and tribulations that are unique to each of them. Along the way, youÃƒÂ¢??ll see exclusive, behind-the-scenes footage of these MX heroes training, traveling, riding, and just plain living the life of a motocross star. Spend a week hanging with rookie sensation Ryan Villopoto as he heads to Colorado to compete in the Lakewood National, or cruise over to a secret freeride spot in Utah in Mike MasonÃƒÂ¢??s motor home; with 6IX, youÃƒÂ¢??ll see the entire range of the sport like you never have before.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99b64eedf70958d0903f7204f7092bc00b34ff8b","amp;dn":"%5BTransworld+Motocross%5D+6IX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99b64eedf70958d0903f7204f7092bc00b34ff8b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,182,78,237,247,9,88,208,144,63,114,4,247,9,43,192,11,52,255,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
