The use of excellent imagery coupled with pretty out-of-the-place background score tells us about the uniqueness of this movie. Stanley Kubrick has really applied a lot of thought into this.\n\nThe director wants the audience to feel something as bad not because he is showing it as bad but because it really is bad. The background music accompanying the ultra violent scenes is comical, and not dramatic or anything else that is commonly associated with such scenes. This gives the viewer an opportunity to feel the bitterness not because the music hints so but because he himself feels so. Viewer&amp;#039;s emotions should arise irrespective of what the director is trying to show, and this is one of the greatest successes of the movie.\n\nAnother glorifying feature is the central idea of the movie. If a human is striped of the choice to choose from good and evil, he no longer remains a human, he becomes a clockwork. When Alex is brain-washed and &quot;programmed&quot; to choose only good, he wasn&amp;#039;t accepted by the society and this shows the irony in the objectives of the British Government. The word Orange from the title presumably comes from the word &quot;Ourange&quot; that loosely means man. And hence the title is so appropriate to the movie.\n\n\n\nEnjoy\n\nLGLuX","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:935bd1785d6c026fb43f89e46352e33146d847db","amp;dn":"A.Clockwork.Orange.DVDRIP.ENG-LGLuX.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"935bd1785d6c026fb43f89e46352e33146d847db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,91,209,120,93,108,2,111,180,63,137,228,99,82,227,49,70,216,71,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
