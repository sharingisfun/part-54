Since then, the series has sold over seven million copies in the United States alone. Now, this phenomenally successful series is being translated into a graphic novel format.\n\nFor the first time, rabid fans will be able to see the underground fairy world, examine Foaly&amp;#039;s incredible inventions, look inside Fowl Manor, and of course follow their favorite criminal mastermind as he plots and connives in glorious full-color panels that bristle with action.[/quote]\n\n[color=dodgerblue][b]BIG THANKS to tsarrack for his debut scan!!!\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE BOOK, THEN BUY THE COMICS OR THE TRADES.
