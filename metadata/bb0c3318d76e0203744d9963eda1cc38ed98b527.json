This is their first album, supercharged with anthems and ready to explode from your stereo. Their live shows are bursting with energy. Attack Of The Vapours has been a Myspace phenomenon, preceded by two sell-out limited run singles. Definitely worth checking out. Hope they&amp;#039;ll come to America soon.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb0c3318d76e0203744d9963eda1cc38ed98b527","amp;dn":"Viper+Squadron+-+Attack+Of+The+Vapours","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb0c3318d76e0203744d9963eda1cc38ed98b527","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,12,51,24,215,110,2,3,116,77,153,99,237,161,204,56,237,152,181,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
