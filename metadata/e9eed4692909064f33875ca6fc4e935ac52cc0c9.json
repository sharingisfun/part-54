Known far and wide as one to the top songwriters, it is amazing to hear what a great singer he was. Kind of a cross between Kenny Loggins and James Taylor only with a voice that conveyed the emotion of a song better than either Loggins or Taylor. \n\nThis album features a list of some of Muscle Shoals finest: Clayton Ivey on keyboards, Roger Clark on drums, Bob Wray&amp;#039;s funky bass, former Steppenwolf guitarist Larry Byrom, Jimmy Buffett&amp;#039;s right-hand man,Mac MacAnally and Terry Woodford&amp;#039;s superb engineering. \n\nEnjoy, please comment and seed\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9eed4692909064f33875ca6fc4e935ac52cc0c9","amp;dn":"Robert+Byrne+-+Blame+it+on+the+night+-+1979+-+West+Coast+pop+roc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9eed4692909064f33875ca6fc4e935ac52cc0c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,238,212,105,41,9,6,79,51,135,92,166,252,78,147,90,197,44,192,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
