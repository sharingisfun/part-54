Within the first minute, you hear segments of that band\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;War Pigs\\&quot; and \\&quot;After Forever.\\&quot; Any band with the cajones to directly lift two songs from Birmingham\\&amp;#039;s finest in the opening song of its first LP deserves some credit. Either that or they\\&amp;#039;re asking for trouble. What the hell, you know? Hip-hop has its share of direct samples, so why not rock &amp; roll? Big Chief is actually playing it, and if you\\&amp;#039;re gonna steal, you might as well steal from the best.\nFace cleans up the sound from the early singles. The rhythm section of bassist Matt O\\&amp;#039;Brien and drummer Mike Danner is given more room to breathe, as everything comes across as more pliable, less cluttered. Just as importantly, Barry Henssler transforms from a vocalist to a singer -- his increased range no longer pins the band into a corner. The record seems to stick to two gears, toggling between charging and deliberate. With some furious soloing, \\&quot;Drive It Off\\&quot; introduces overt bluesiness into the band\\&amp;#039;s repertoire, while the stomping \\&quot;Desert Jam\\&quot; matches the molasses-paced lurchers of early Soundgarden and Jane\\&amp;#039;s Addiction.\n\n\n\n                            \n01.
