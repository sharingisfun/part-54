It was the fourth release from the group&amp;#039;s Silk and Steel album, and reached #15 (UK); #13 (US R&amp;B).\n\nThe theme to the video was the band staying in an old castle, occupied by a comical Count Dracula, who tries to arrange a date with the band&amp;#039;s lead singer, Denise. He also tries to copy the band&amp;#039;s dance moves, with comical effect. A remixed version of the song appeared on the group&amp;#039;s 1989 Greatest Hits album.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52df02a8868e591c4d25cb8419087b12c6160232","amp;dn":"Five+Star+-+If+I+Say+Yes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52df02a8868e591c4d25cb8419087b12c6160232","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,223,2,168,134,142,89,28,77,37,203,132,25,8,123,18,198,22,2,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
