They were easily as good as the headliners. Steve Mann, the guitarist, ended up in McAuley Schenker Group and then Andy Scott&amp;#039;s Sweet. Drummer, Clive Brooks was from Groundhogs. This is their second album. Apparently there was a third, but it never released! C&amp;#039;mon ... somebody must have access to it somewhere.\n\n\nTrack Listing: Liar - Set The World On Fire \n\nSet The World on Fire \nTown of Evil People \nI&amp;#039;m Calling \nMidnight Promises \nFive Knuckle Shuffle \nHigh Life \nFrustration \nWho Cares \n\n\nMusicians: Liar - Set The World On Fire \n\nDave Burton \nDave Taylor \nSteve Mann \nClive Brooks \nPaul Travis\n\nProduced by John Alcock for Delta Productions\n\n\nRipped from good quality vinyl for your listening pleasure. The vinyl was centralized which means there was absolutely no side to side movement of the tone arm. This is usually the major flaw with vinyl as it causes a &quot;WOWING&quot; effect noticable to most audiophiles. It is caused by the hole not being entirely central and is more annoying than the occasional click in my opinion. Also in use on the Dual 505 Record Deck was a Platter Pad [a solid rubber, turntable mat, about 1 and a half cm thick] which no user of vinyl should be without. It enhances the sound no end!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d853c6173058780f4e7ed93cc33caef0661962d7","amp;dn":"Liar+-+Set+The+World+On+Fire+%5B1978%5D+HQ+Vinyl+%40+128kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d853c6173058780f4e7ed93cc33caef0661962d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,83,198,23,48,88,120,15,78,126,217,60,195,60,174,240,102,25,98,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
