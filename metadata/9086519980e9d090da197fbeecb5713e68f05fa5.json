One of the most prolific Greek composers, he considerably enriched the musical heritage of modern Greece with his work, thus creating a unique point of reference. His contribution to the creation of a distinctly Greek symphonic sound has been very definite. He started his musical education in Athens and Constantinople and completed it in Vienna between 1901 and 1906, he settled permanently in Athens, in 1910. Kalomiris founded two of the most important Conservatories in Greece as well as the Union of Greek Composers, and served for a time as director of the National Opera. His large output includes 3 symphonies, and 5 operas and hundreds of songs.\n\n?Mother&amp;#039;s Ring? by Manolis Kalomiris is a greek opera full of tenderness. Kalomiris began writting the work in 1915 and completed it almost after one and a half year. Inspiration for the author stood his acquaintance with the poet Kambissis, who died very young. Kalomiris knew the mother of the undeservedly lost poet and was inspired by her for this work that develops during christmas days at the greek countryside.\n\nThe plot of the opera develops at Christmas&amp;#039; Eve in a Greek village. Giannakis the singer is heavily sick. His mother tries to give him courage, while at the same time decides to sell her ancestors&amp;#039; ring, despite the wish and the curse that she must never disembody it, in order to cure her child.\n\nRelated Links: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kalomiris.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kalomiris.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTechnical Characteristics:\nRipper:  dBpoweramp  v12.4 (Secure Mode)\n\n(MP3:  213Mb)\nEncoder:  LAME v3.97\nSettings:  -V 0 --vbr-new\nEstimated bitrate:  240 kbps (VBR)\nStereo Mode:  Joint Stereo\n\n(FLAC:  512Mb)\nEncoder:  FLAC v1.2.1\nSettings:  -8 -V","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9086519980e9d090da197fbeecb5713e68f05fa5","amp;dn":"Manolis+Kalomiris+-+Mother%5C%27s+Ring+%5Bgreek+classical+opera%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9086519980e9d090da197fbeecb5713e68f05fa5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,134,81,153,128,233,208,144,218,25,127,190,236,181,113,62,104,240,95,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
