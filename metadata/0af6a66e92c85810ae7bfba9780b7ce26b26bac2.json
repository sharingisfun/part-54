During this\nexplosion Perry Rhodan&amp;#039;s immediate confidante Mondra is kidnapped by\nextraterrestrial combat robots. Alone he tries to find the true reasons for\nthe irruption as well as the manipulators behind the conspiracy. During his\nsearch he discovers recordings about the myth of a thought to be dead,\nextraterrestrial race that had enslaved humanity a long, long time ago ? the\nIllochim. With bravery, cleverness and brilliant investigation, he manages to\nlight up the darkness.\nHis untiring search leads him to many foreign races across the galaxy, away\nfrom his mother planet Terra to the subterranean colonies of the planet Gom\nCallaedus in undiscovered enemy territory. While fighting with organ traders\nand exiled criminals the secret behind the dangerous incidents is finally\nsolved: the truth about the awakened, life-threatening danger for the\nresidents of the Milky Way is lying buried on the far away moon Betha.\nPerry Rhodan Features:\n    * Cinematic Gameplay - More than 120 movie-like scenes and more than 50\n      fully animated real-time characters with facial expression and lip-sync\n      voiceovers. Each picture is brought to life through countless,\n      real-time effect animations.\n    * Special Effects - All appearing 3D objects are fully enlightened by\n      numerous light sources that make the scenes appear absolutely\n      movie-like.\n    * Breathtaking Design - The high performance engine allows the handling\n      of trick techniques that are also used for large movie productions.\nProper note:\n~~~~~~~~~~~~\nHey guys, time to clear up some mystery...today we present Vitality&amp;#039;s oath of\ndisclosure. ;)\nQuote from Perry.Rhodan.PROPER-ViTALiTY: &quot;We have to ruin our nfo because\nsome retard group in disguise released this...&quot;\nWell, they ruined their nfo themselves, let&amp;#039;s go for their reputation\nthen...;)\nThe &quot;retarded group in disguise&quot; is obviously Razor1911.\nAs we don&amp;#039;t have any german subgroup and we decided that this game was still\nworthy of a release, we put it out by the dummy name of &quot;REDHERRING&quot;\n(Perry.Rhodan.GERMAN-REDHERRING).\nNeed proof?\nHave a close look at the CRC32 value at offset 0x8C of the cracked exe\nincluded with either Perry.Rhodan.GERMAN-REDHERRING or\nPerry.Rhodan.CRACKFiX.GERMAN-REDHERRING.\nQuote continues: &quot;... with the german download exe used for crack.&quot;\nFirst of all, with minimum research on their part they could&amp;#039;ve known that no\nsuch thing as a &quot;german download exe&quot; which could aid in cracking the\nSolidshield part of the protection even exists. As of today the only\navailable ones are protected exactly the same way as the boxed retail\nedition. So there&amp;#039;s simply no way we could&amp;#039;ve used such kind of binary for\nour cracks. Period.\nSecondly, anyone with a little knowledge of how modern compilers generate x86\nbinary code should&amp;#039;ve seen at a glance that our rebuilt code hasn&amp;#039;t been\ngenerated by MSVC (which was used for compiling the original exe). However,\nthis neither kept Vitality from ripping (i.e. STEALING) all the code\ngenerated by our tools from Perry.Rhodan.CRACKFiX.GERMAN-REDHERRING nor -\nwhich is even funnier - did it keep Deep Silver from declaring our code a rip\nfrom an early beta of the game (maybe we should think about deliberately\ndegrading our cracks&amp;#039; quality for making them recognizable as such...;)).\nUnluckily for vitality we embedded a wide range of watermarks in order to\nidentify possible crack stealers.\nHere&amp;#039;s just one example for those who need proof :\nPerry.Rhodan.CRACKFiX.GERMAN-REDHERRING:\n.text:004319DA                 push    12h             ; char\n.text:004319DC                 push    4               ; int\n.text:004319DE                 call    sub_401330\n.text:004319E3                 int     3               ; Trap to Debugger\n.\n.\n.\nPerry.Rhodan.PROPER-ViTALiTY:\nvitality:00810ACB              push    12h             ; char\nvitality:00810ACD              push    4               ; int\nvitality:00810ACF              call    sub_401330\nvitality:00810AD4              int     3               ; Trap to Debugger\n.\n.\n.\nOriginal code executed within the Solidshield VM:\n.text:0065A5C7                 push    12h             ; char\n.text:0065A5C9                 push    4               ; int\n.text:0065A5CB                 call    sub_401330\n.text:0065A5D0                 add     esp, 18h\n.\n.\n.\nThere are dozens of others (like e.g. removed redundant code, modified\ninstruction order et. al., all of which still give functionally equivalent\ncode) but those are for you to find out...;)\nFinally, as a result of not being able to rebuild the Solidshield VM code on\ntheir own (and obviously not even being able to deal with standard STDCALL\nargument passing) they had to include a messy workaround (for some code they\ncouldn&amp;#039;t simply cut &amp; paste from our german exe, 0x62E1F0) which is likely to\ncause memory leaks and/or random crashes sooner or later. Not experiencing\nany problems is basically just a matter of chance.\nQuote continues: &quot;Their exe is also a different/older build. Also most text\nis buggy (speechtext, game options, items,..).&quot;\nThis is simply owing to the fact that we neither put out nor authorized the\nenglish -REDHERRING release. Obviously someone else thought it was a funny\nidea to repack the english version with our german crack and release it by\nthe same name...\nSorry for the long delay of this release, but we wanted to make sure that\neverything was ok.\n\n&quot;A celebrated people lose dignity upon a closer view.&quot; - Napoleon Bonaparte\n Install Notes\n ~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n 1.
