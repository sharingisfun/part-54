The film was initially released on October 25, 2007, and in the United States on October 26, 2007. The film&amp;#039;s North American release date follows the series&amp;#039; tradition that the films be released the Friday before or on Halloween of each year. This installment continues the story of the Jigsaw Killer, and his obsession with teaching people the value of their own lives. Although Jigsaw died in the last installment (Saw III), this film focuses on his ability to manipulate people into continuing his work. Saw IV was directed by Saw II and Saw III director Darren Lynn Bousman alongside with co-creators James Wan and Leigh Whannell returning as executive producers.[4] Unlike the previous three films, Saw IV was not written by either Wan or Whannel.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:651ec9ed53c5fdb04e7f604ce6fbe2ef1b6b2bba","amp;dn":"SAW+IV+-+%5BENG%5D%5B2007%5D+-+LIBRE+%26+VERITAS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"651ec9ed53c5fdb04e7f604ce6fbe2ef1b6b2bba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,30,201,237,83,197,253,176,78,127,96,76,230,251,226,239,27,107,43,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
