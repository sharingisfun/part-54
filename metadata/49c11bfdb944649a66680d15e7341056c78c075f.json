Whichever team wins a mission gets to pick someone of the same sex, either male or female, depending on the Gauntlet day, from the other team. They pick two people, a person who will compete in the Gauntlet, and another person who is safe from competing in the Gauntlet that night. The losing team then votes someone from their own team who they want to compete against the chosen person by the winning team. The two teammates then battle it out in the Gauntlet. The same person can not be saved twice in a row. Unlike before there will be no team bank accounts the final mission will be worth $300,000. The only way to earn money is to make it to the final challenge and be on the winning team. Smaller prizes such as phones and vacations will be handed out to winners on the way to the final mission.\n\n\n(I am sorry for the file size as once again, these are purchased from amazon.com.
