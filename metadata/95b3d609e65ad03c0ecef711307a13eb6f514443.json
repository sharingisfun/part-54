This one is not only makes the improvement of moving the separate issues into a single .cbr file, but it also includes Pasko&amp;#039;s work on Doctor Fate in Flash before Gerber started giving him a helping hand. I have no idea why that later story was team-written or to what extent the collaboration was. Something to discover later.\n\nAgain, thanks to the original scanners and the Flash torrent where I took these from.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95b3d609e65ad03c0ecef711307a13eb6f514443","amp;dn":"Doctor+Fate+-+Flash++-+306-313+-+Steve+Gerber-Martin+Pasko+updat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95b3d609e65ad03c0ecef711307a13eb6f514443","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,179,214,9,230,90,208,60,14,206,247,17,48,122,19,235,111,81,68,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
