Check back on fanedit.org for updates on this and hundreds of other fan edits.\n\n-------\n\nWhy would someone want to download an edited version of South Park? Because the events have been meticulously rearranged to transition between the three characters&amp;#039; separate stories into a complete whole. A person with an actual life edited this, in their very limited spare time, purely for fun. If you don&amp;#039;t like the idea of someone doing something creative with South Park, then don&amp;#039;t bother with this.\n\nIf you hit and run on this torrent and any other of mine (that is, download the whole thing and don&amp;#039;t bother to seed) you thoroughly deserve to have your ISP poison your torrents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e10a56060b86a62377a834ca9c67064746c99055","amp;dn":"The+Meteor+Shower%3A+A+Night+In+South+Park+-+fan+edited+by+Ghostcu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e10a56060b86a62377a834ca9c67064746c99055","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,10,86,6,11,134,166,35,119,168,52,202,156,103,6,71,70,201,144,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
