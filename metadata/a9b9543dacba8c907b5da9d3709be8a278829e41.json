I have 3 out of the 4 installments, one of which I have already posted (A Lethal Dose of Hard Psych). I also have &quot;An Overdose of Heavy Psych&quot;, which I will be posting next. I&amp;#039;ll try to find out the name of the remaining album, and post it if I&amp;#039;m able to find it. Here are the notes that were included:\n\nTrip on out to 26 excessive tracks (over 78 minutes) of sparkling ?60s psychedelic acid reign. Presented here is elusive American psychedelic rock at it?s best?from the savage to the sublime, massive to the mesmirizing, and futuristic to flashbacks.\n\nDeadly Dose of Wylde Psych is another wild compilation from Arf Arf that digs up 26 tracks of long lost American psychedelic acid rock from the mid-&amp;#039;60s. These tracks were recorded during an era when garage bands switched from &quot;Louie Louie&quot; and &quot;Gloria&quot; to a darker, yet no less inept, age of acid-influenced sludge. During the 78 minutes of Deadly Dose, listeners are introduced to beyond obscure bands with names like Chocolate Moose, Peacepipe, Lime Frost, Nite Watchmen, and Sweet Cherry. Most of these tracks sound like a combination of the Music Machine or Count Five with Barry Melton or Jorma Kaukonen on electric guitar at their most hallucinogenic.\n\nTrack List:\n01.Sound Apparatus - Travel Agent Man \n02.Finch - Nothing In The Sun \n03.Nite Watchmen - Mimic Jester \n04.Sweet Cherry - Funny Things Floating \n05.Peacepipe - The Sun Won?t Shine Forever \n06.Moon Dawgs - Keep On Pushing \n07.Blue Creed - Need A Friend \n08.Chocolate Moose - Take A Ride \n09.Pawnbrokers - Realize \n10.Christian Brothers - Feeling Bad \n11.Oscar And The Majestics - House Of The Rising Sun \n12.Liberation News Service - Mid-Winter?s Afternoon \n13.Wet Paint - Glass Road\n14.Waters - Mother Samwell \n15.Chaparral Trio - Roxanne \n16.Lime Frost - Post Bellum Blues \n17.Leather Pages - Accept Me For Who I Am \n18.The Blues Inc. - And Is \n19.Wildwood - Plastic People \n20.Portraits - It Had To Be You \n21.(Mikes) Mijal &amp; White - I?ve Been You \n22.Tea Company - Come And Have Some Tea With Me \n23.Angel Angel Down We Go, Attack - School Daze\n24.Attack - School Daze \n25.Mass Temper - Gravedigger \n26.Johnny Thompson Quintet - Color Me Columbuth","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9b9543dacba8c907b5da9d3709be8a278829e41","amp;dn":"A+Deadly+Dose+Of+Wylde+Psych","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9b9543dacba8c907b5da9d3709be8a278829e41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,185,84,61,172,186,140,144,123,93,169,211,112,155,232,162,120,130,158,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
