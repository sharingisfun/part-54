However they were a little rawer back then, and some of my favorite songs, like &quot;Ring on the Sill,&quot; got lots of plays.\n\n \n\nThe recording I have is an audience, but still sounds quite good.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f05155ecb025b3ce077b1e51ea5ca6f0b129caed","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies+1994-06-24+%40+Bathurst+Theater+-+Toronto%2C+ON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f05155ecb025b3ce077b1e51ea5ca6f0b129caed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,81,85,236,176,37,179,206,7,123,30,81,234,92,166,240,177,41,202,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
