What is WinTools.net?\n2. Features\n3. Version history\n4. License and distribution\n5. Contacts\n\n\n1. What is WinTools.net?\n\nA suite of tools for increasing operating system performance. \nWinTools.net cleanly removes unwanted software from disk drives \nand dead references from the Windows registry. WinTools.net puts\nyou in control of the Windows start up process, memory monitoring\nand gives you the power to customize desktop and system settings \nto fit your needs. \nWinTools.net Home contains tools: Clean Uninstaller, Scan Files, \nScan Registry, Start Up, Tweak UI... \n\nSystem requirements. \nOS MS Windows Me/2000/XP/2003/VISTA x86\nMinimum screen resolution 800x600 \nPentium processor\n5 Mb free disk space \n\nAttention! To use this program you need the administrator`s rights. \nBefore working with the WinTools.net we recommend that you close \nall other applications and create registry backup. \n\n\n2. Features\n\nWintools features the following tools:\n\nClean Uninstaller - This tool is used for both correctly removing \nsoftware and for monitoring changes made to the hard drive, \nMS Windows registry and system files during program installations.\n\n When you uninstall different software, temporary files and files \nnot deleted in the process of uninstallation often remain on the \nhard disk. These files are no longer used, they take up disk space \nand increase disk access times. With the help of the tool &quot;Clean \nUninstaller&quot; you can solve that problem. You can also control the \ninstallation process of program, monitor installed files and changes \nmade to the Windows registry system files during installation. \n\n\nScan Files - This tool is used for periodic cleaning of your hard \ndrive from dead references, junk and obsolete files produced by \ndifferent software. These files and references remain on the hard \ndisk and increase drive access time.\n\n When different programs are running, temporary files necessary for \nthe proper functioning those programs are created on hard disk. \nQuite often these temporary files are not deleted. The temporary \nfiles remain on hard disk, occupy the space and sometimes slowing \nthe work of your computer. The tool &quot;Scan Files&quot; is used for periodic \ncleaning of the computer from temporary and unused files. \n\n\nScan Registry - This tool is used for periodic cleaning of the \nMS Windows registry from unused applications remained after \nuninstallation and from invalid references which decrease system \nspeed and system loading time.\n\n Many programs store information about themselves in the Windows \nregistry; these programs add new file extension associations and \ninstall components of their own. Far too often, the unistallation \nmethods used by these programs fail to remove their information from \nthe registry adding unnecessary bloat. After several series of \ninstallation/uninstallation, the Windows registry becomes bigger \nand bigger; computer power declines and program access times increase. \nThe &quot;Scan Registry&quot; tool serves for periodic cleaning of the registry \nand for correcting incorrect registry records.\n\n\nStart Up - This is a startup manager. This tool allows you to monitor, \nadd, remove, enable and/or disable individual startup items. You can \nalso adjust applications  initialized during the loading process of \nthe operating system.\n\n Many programs &quot;consider&quot; themselves the most important programs in \na system: they place themselves in startup and in a System Tray of \na system. This leads to unreasonable using of system resources, of \nrandom access memory; and finally, to reducing processor power. As \na rule, such programs write information about themselves not in the \nStart section of the &quot;Startup&quot; menu, but in the Windows registry without \nleaving the option to the user and complicating the process of checking \nthe autothread process. The &quot;Start Up&quot; tool monitors all records about \nautothread and allows to delete/add and temporarily disable records. \n\n\nTweak UI - This is a set of additional adjustments related to safety, \nsystem capacity and user preferences and which are not included into \nbasic components of MS Windows.\n\n Adjustments are divided into six groups: \n\nGlobal - adjustments which allow for changing system files and \nregistration information. \nDesktop ? a set of adjustments that can be made to the desktop. \nSystem ? system settings, ways of the loading of a system and devices. \nStartMenu ? a change of the interface of a Start menu. \nSecurity ? an adjustment of security of a system. \nCtrl Panel ? a manager of the bars used for the administration of \na system. \n\n\n3.
