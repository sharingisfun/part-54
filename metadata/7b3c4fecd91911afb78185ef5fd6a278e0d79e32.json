Their fourth album finds them continuing confidently down the path they've established, as Brad Arnold's voice contrasts heavyweight wailing with contemplative near-crooning. Rampaging riff monsters like &quot;Train&quot; rub shoulders with the power balladry of &quot;Your Arms Feel Like Home,&quot; as the band's trademark mix of raw energy and melodic pop unfurls itself once more.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b3c4fecd91911afb78185ef5fd6a278e0d79e32","amp;dn":"3+Doors+Down+-+3+Doors+Down+%5B2008%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b3c4fecd91911afb78185ef5fd6a278e0d79e32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,60,79,236,217,25,17,175,183,129,133,239,95,214,162,120,224,215,158,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
