This album documents those years (the performances here are from 1964 to &amp;#039;68) with uproarious samplings of Allen&amp;#039;s live act. Perhaps unsurprisingly, Allen&amp;#039;s standup persona differed little from the one he presented in his early films - that of a sarcastic, self-effacing nebbish confounded by the most basic functions of everyday life.\n\nAs in his movies, Allen plays up his Jewishness (a possible holdover from the borscht belt days) for maximum comedic effect, using stereotypical Jewish neuroses as a powerful comedic building block. Besides being a hilarious comedy album, STANDUP COMIC also provides a peek into Allen&amp;#039;s writing process, as some of the jokes here would resurface years later in Allen&amp;#039;s cinematic efforts.\n\n\nNotes\n\nOriginally released seperately as Woody Allen, Colpix (518); Woody Allen 2, Colpix (488); The Third Woody Allen Album, Capitol (2986).\n\nRecorded at Mr. Kelly&amp;#039;s, Chicago, Illinois in March 1964; The Shadows, Washington D.C. in April 1965; Eugene&amp;#039;s, San Francisco, California in August 1968.\n\nCompilation producers: Woody Allen, Steve Tyrell.\n\nEngineers include: Don Geis, George Horn, Jerry DeClerq.\n\n\nTracks\n\n1.
