When Alan Lorber re-mixed the master tapes for\nthe CD re-issue some years back he changed the sound substantially and also\nchopped more than 10 minutes from the original playing time. Sadly, my copy\nis by no means perfect and there is a horrible scratch on Genesis Of Beauty which\nI have tried to erradicate as far as possible, but which cannot be totally removed\nwithout destroying the track in the process. There are also some other less prominent scratches and crackle which have been difficult to remove elsewhere on the record, but this is inevitable with a record that is 40 years old.\n\nSampled from the original vinyl at 44KHz, 16-bit stereo. \nScratch removal using Brian Davies&amp;#039; ClickRepair v2.21. \nNoise removal and normalisation with Audacity 1.3.4.\nEncoded at 320kbps CBR using LAME.\nMP3 tags by TagScanner 5.0.\n\nEnjoy :)\n\n\nUltimate Spinach - Behold And See\n\nSide 1:\n\nGilded Lamp Of The Cosmos\nVisions Of Your Reality\nJazz Thing\nMind Flowers\n\n\nSide 2:\n\nWhere You&amp;#039;re At\nSuite: Genesis Of Beauty (in four parts)\nFifth Horseman Of The Apocalypse\nFragmentary March Of Green\n\n\nProduced by Alan Lorber, engineer Val Valentin, Harry Yarmark\n\n(P) 1968 MGM SE-4570\n\nAll tracks written and arranged by Ian Bruce-Douglas\n\nIan Bruce-Douglas - Vocals, keyboards?\nBarbara Hudson - Vocals, kazoo, guitar\nKeith Lahteinen - Vocals, drums, percusion\nRichard Nese - Bass\nGeoffrey Winthrop - vocals, guitar, sitar\n\nDe-clicked at 30 with pitch-protection \nexcept &quot;Genesis&quot; manual fix for scratch\nbetween 5.58 and 6.25 then de-clicked at 30.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:562319268a6e6af245d397becb7863140fd1158e","amp;dn":"Ultimate+Spinach+-+Behold+And+See+%5BMP3+320Kbps+CBR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"562319268a6e6af245d397becb7863140fd1158e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,35,25,38,138,110,106,242,69,211,151,190,203,120,99,20,15,209,21,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
