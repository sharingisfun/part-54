This release contains 6 bonus tracks and is Remastered to CD standards. The soundquality has much improved compared to the original issue. (Trust me, I've got both versions :)  \n\nThe Artwork is from the original release containing only 5 tracks on the backcover.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP. (The Quality Music Project)\n\nIn this project me and my fellow pirates share only quality items out of our CD collections in lossless FLAC and include covers, especially for those who like to burn and print and put it in a nice and shiny jewelcase.
