This is just another prime example of a band/collaboration which didnÃƒÂ¢??t last long enough to become the next Tangerine Dream, yet could have. For it is such a shame that time will pass over us, and listeners of electronic music in the next decade may not even know who they are. These guys have created electronic trance-like rhythms which are highly addictive, clever, and impeccable. Nevertheless, let us remain grateful that we have witnessed such genius in our lifetime.\n\nkeywords: ambient, electronic, music, kraut rock, space rock, tangerine dream\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8e70190f4451588060cb7c2a250f56f97b6a47c","amp;dn":"Kubusschnitt+-+The+Cube%2C+The+Singularity%2C+Nightshade","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8e70190f4451588060cb7c2a250f56f97b6a47c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,231,1,144,244,69,21,136,6,12,183,194,162,80,245,111,151,182,164,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
