You&amp;#039;ll probably only find this pack useful if you&amp;#039;re into ambient, experimental, or industrial soundtracks.\n\nFull details and Acid projects available at: http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/loop_libraries/showloop.asp?SPID=442\n\nCD Rip is in BIN/CUE format, so you need to mount it with PowerISO or burn it to CD-R.\n\n262 loops. 607MB.\n\n--\nArty - &quot;Haunted dancefloor?&quot;\n28th February 2008.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b239dd8f885f10bbb4f5e0855e173775f64ffc8e","amp;dn":"ArtyTorrent+Pack+95-Loop+Noir+Paranormal+Sound+Design-WAV+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b239dd8f885f10bbb4f5e0855e173775f64ffc8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,57,221,143,136,95,16,187,180,245,224,133,94,23,55,117,246,79,252,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
