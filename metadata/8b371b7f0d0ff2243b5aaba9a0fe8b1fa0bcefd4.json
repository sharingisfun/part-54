The film follows the exploits and downfall of a Nazi skinhead group in blue-collar suburban Melbourne.\n\nThe soundtrack released on Picture This Records includes orchestral music, as well as dark, energetic music similar to the Oi! genre (recorded by studio musicians). The film was nominated for 9 Australian Film Institute Awards, winning Best Achievement in Sound, Best Actor in a Lead Role and Best Original Music Score.\n\nDaniel Pollock, who plays Davey in the film, committed suicide before the film&amp;#039;s release by jumping in front of a train. He had been struggling with a serious heroin addiction, as well as the breakup of his romantic relationship with co-star Jacqueline McKenzie. Crowe wrote a song about the suicide called &quot;The Night That Davey Hit the Train&quot; which he later performed with his band 30 Odd Foot of Grunts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b371b7f0d0ff2243b5aaba9a0fe8b1fa0bcefd4","amp;dn":"ROMPER+STOMPER+-+%5BENG%5D%5B1992%5D+-+LIBRE+%26+VERITAS+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b371b7f0d0ff2243b5aaba9a0fe8b1fa0bcefd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,55,27,127,13,15,242,36,59,90,171,169,160,254,139,31,160,188,239,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
