They travel across Route 666 conducting psychadelic mass-slaughters not for money, not for revenge, just for kicks. Glorified by the media, the pair become legendary folk heroes; their story told by the single person they leave alive at the scene of each of their slaughters.

He soon helps her kill her abusive father (Rodney Dangerfield) and enabling mother (Edie McClurg), beginning their macabre journey down Route 666. Their M.O.: every few miles, they attack everyone within their site, invariably leaving only one person alive to tell the tale. The two are made famous by unscrupulous reporter Wayne Gale (Robert Downy jr.), as they run across the countryside, pursued by the equally sadistic Jack Scagnetti (Tom Sizemore). Just before the trial, a ratings-whoring interview by the same reporter who made them famous leads to pandemonium, not just within the prison itself, but nationwide. A satire of the media, public opinion, and the modern attitude toward violence. Written by T. Brendan Leahy.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nDivx format, good for playing on a PS3 , the file is a bit large but that is because I like my ripped movies to be good quality.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abcba7438c6711e9e4f52030f7b87a0664a06109","amp;dn":"Natural_Born_Killers+Divx+AC3.6Ch+16%3A9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abcba7438c6711e9e4f52030f7b87a0664a06109","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,203,167,67,140,103,17,233,228,245,32,48,247,184,122,6,100,160,97,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
