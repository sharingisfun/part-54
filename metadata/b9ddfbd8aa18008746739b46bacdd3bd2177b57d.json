However, upon growing up he found it difficult to get a job, and spends most of his time using his skill to give the police anonymous tips. However, the tips are so good that some cops become suspicious that he is involved with the crimes himself. To clear his name Shawn finally settles on a career: he pretends to be a psychic. No one really believes him, but he continues to be so helpful to the police that they keep calling him in on cases they can&amp;#039;t solve. Shawn soon brings his childhood friend Gus into his scheme, and between their bantering they manage to solve every case they&amp;#039;re presented with.\n\nThis is all of the episodes from season 1 &amp; 2.
