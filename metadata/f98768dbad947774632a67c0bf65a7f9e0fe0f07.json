Desperate to score points with his boss (McAllister), he commits to a favor he can&amp;#039;t afford. He ends up in a rundown truck headed to L.A. with his boss&amp;#039;s possessions, his Hollywood-bound niece, and her pet pig. Amidst hitch-hikers, breakdowns, and assorted local yokels, Rick finds love, life and maybe himself in this trans-American road trip from hell.
