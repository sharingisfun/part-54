As you know, there are many installers in the world, such as InstallShield, Wise Installer, Microsoft Installer and many others. Most applications are built using these installers. Each installer has a unique install database, which makes it difficult to find all the changes programs&amp;#039; make to your computer. That&amp;#039;s why other uninstallers can only uninstall part of an application-leaving some files and registry keys. To solve this problem, Your Uninstaller! uses it&amp;#039;s unique technique: SmartUninstallÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢. SmartUninstallÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢ has a database containing information about all installers on the market; so when it uninstalls a program, it automatically detects which installer the application used, then it simply uninstalls the application properly. That&amp;#039;s the reason Your Uninstaller! can detect and completely remove all the programs and icons on your computer. \n\nSounds complex? It&amp;#039;s not! All the steps used by Your Uninstaller! are done with simple clicks. You won&amp;#039;t even notice the analysis process. \n\nCompletely Uninstall \nYour Uninstaller! uninstaller program completely takes the place of Windows Add/Remove program, while offering you many more features. Your Uninstaller can list &quot;hidden&quot; programs that you can&amp;#039;t view using the Windows Add/Remove program. The standard Add/Remove program often can&amp;#039;t uninstall applications completely-leaving broken registry keys and unused files on the hard disk. Big registries and large numbers of unnecessary files make system slow. Your Uninstaller! clears broken keys and files in seconds using SmartUninstallÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¢! \n\nFast and User-Friendly \nYour Uninstaller! uninstaller program starts 500-1000% times faster than Windows Add/Remove program. It also appropriately loads all applications and icons, so you can easily find the programs you wish to uninstall. Your Uninstaller! also contains a handy search function.\n\nEasy to use \nYour Uninstaller! automatically detects broken registry keys from you Add/Remove list, and clears them entirely with your permission. Your Uninstaller! can also detect unused files left by previous uninstalls-it will prompt you before it completely the deletes these files. Even a single drag-drop performs an uninstall process! All Your Uninstaller! processes come with step-by-step instructions and can be performed with a few simple clicks or drag-drops. \n\nGet rid of spywares \nYour Uninstaller! also contains an internal Startup Organizer that safely removes or hides unwanted auto-run applications.
