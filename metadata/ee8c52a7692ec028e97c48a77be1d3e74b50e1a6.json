The show was co-created by executive producers Chuck Lorre and Lee Aronsohn, debuting on Monday, September 22, 2003, at 9:30 p.m., ET/PT. In its third season, starting September 2005, it moved to Mondays at 9:00 p.m. (taking Everybody Loves Raymond&amp;#039;s time slot). Two and a Half Men debuted in local syndication in September 2007, also soon to be syndicated on the FX cable network in 2010.[1] Production on the show was halted on November 6, 2007 due to the 2007 Writers&amp;#039; Strike.[2] However, once the strike ended (announced February 13, 2008) the show returned March 17, 2008 with 9 episodes to come.
