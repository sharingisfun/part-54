Hence the name. Quite obvious, isn't it?\n\nThe episodes are as follows:\n\nThe Magic Touch - Compiled from rare and classic footage. Tommy takes us through some riotous sketches in his own off-the-cuff style. Join him and guests Eric Sykes and Henry Cooper as they encounter Nautical Cooper, Accountant Cooper, Courting Cooper, Troubadour Tommy and the grand finale - the Amazing Shirt Trick. \n\nTribute to a Comic Genius - ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all here: the bizarre conjuring tricks, the comic antics and TommyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique brand of humour, exactly as you remember him. Also included are heartfelt tributes from many of TommyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s friends and colleagues, including Benny Hill, Jim Davidson, Ronnie Barker, Mike Yarwood, Eric Sykes, Max Bygraves, and Eammon Andrews.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6a391e942052476bb5ad6f26b912aab17df87d4","amp;dn":"Tommy+Cooper+-+Just+Like+That","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6a391e942052476bb5ad6f26b912aab17df87d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,163,145,233,66,5,36,118,187,90,214,242,107,145,42,171,23,223,135,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
