By this time of night I&amp;#039;m a little too drunk to do any serious analyzation of any music but I will tell you this:  Download the Demon Days! Ones of my favorite albums of all time and the reason I respect Danger Mouse so much as a producer. This is a must hear. And in lossless FLAC!? My god! Sweet Jesus! Get it now!\n\nHere&amp;#039;s the list:\n\nCD: Gorillaz - Demon Days\n       YEAR: 2005\n\n01. Intro    [0:01:03.12]\n02. Last Living Souls    [0:03:10.30]\n03. Kids With Guns    [0:03:45.63]\n04. O Green World    [0:04:31.72]\n05. Dirty Harry    [0:03:43.60]\n06. Feel Good Inc.    [0:03:41.13]\n07. El MaÃƒÂ±ana    [0:03:50.02]\n08. Every Planet We Reach Is Dead    [0:04:53.20]\n09. November Has Come    [0:02:41.08]\n10. All Alone    [0:03:30.05]\n11. White Light    [0:02:08.32]\n12. Dare    [0:04:04.23]\n13. Fire Coming Out Of The Monkey&amp;#039;s Head    [0:03:16.32]\n14. Don&amp;#039;t Get Lost In Heaven    [0:02:00.28]\n15. Demon Days    [0:04:28.67]\n\nShit this is from 2005!? That&amp;#039;s older than I thought!  Anyway, I still play this album regularly and it&amp;#039;s great. Totally different than the first gorillaz album (not that I didn&amp;#039;t like that one too) - all the tracks flow smoothly into the next and its completely beautiful. I forgot to make a log file for this one but its ripped with EAC 0.99 and checked with AccurateRip.  Tracks 2, 6, and 7 had &quot;suspicious positions&quot; but I have played through them personally and didn&amp;#039;t notice anything different from what I normally hear with the CD in the CD player.\n\nCongratulations on your download! Support the artists!\n\n-slavetothesound","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:abb26f3c2343450f551a82fb898f30f3b6735fdd","amp;dn":"Gorillaz+-+Demon+Days+-+slavetothesound%5C%27s+FLAC+series+no+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"abb26f3c2343450f551a82fb898f30f3b6735fdd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,178,111,60,35,67,69,15,85,26,130,251,137,143,48,243,182,115,95,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
