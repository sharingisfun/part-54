John Candy is the emotiuonally troubled wagon master who previously guided the Donner Party and became a vegetarian aftwerwards.\nThis movie was panned by critics and public, but very funny nevertheless. I think it deserves way more credit than it got. It&amp;#039;s not a continuous laugh fest and some of the comedy fails. Possibly it fails at times because it takes hilarious  at historical moments of which that the movie goers were ignorant. In my opinion, this movie has many brilliant comedic moments. I also think it is one of John Candy&amp;#039;s best movies.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86419b0ab6aa39be421efc3a4f4bd65c548c8b1d","amp;dn":"Wagons+East+DivxRipBy+RUBrToe.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86419b0ab6aa39be421efc3a4f4bd65c548c8b1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,65,155,10,182,170,57,190,66,30,252,58,79,75,214,92,84,140,139,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
