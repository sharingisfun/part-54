The purpose for the edit; so you don&amp;#039;t get bored. You won&amp;#039;t miss anything. Unless you like endless chase scenes, lame red herrings, shower scenes with NO nudity and completely black screentime (seriously).\n\nThe source was VHS. This rare film has never been released on DVD. The file format is M4V 640x480. Looks good considering the source. Will play on an iPod and just about any player (Quicktime, VLC, MPlayer, AppleTV)\n\nApril Fools Day (working title)\n1986\nOriginal Runtime: 90 minutes\nRemix Runtime: 38 minutes\n\nSlaughter High is the perfect fueled-by-cocaine movie. The music sucks. I mean, it really sucks. The film looks like shit. The characters are cocky. The clothing is ridiculous.\n\nBUT explosions, motorcycle crashes, creative special effects, boobs, melodrama, boom mikes, a holiday theme and fake American accents. \n\nHave Fun - HorrorRemix.com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21dfc41a04abf4478e903f7162ad11417be280a1","amp;dn":"Slaughter+High+%281986%29+Horror+Remix","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21dfc41a04abf4478e903f7162ad11417be280a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,223,196,26,4,171,244,71,142,144,63,113,98,173,17,65,123,226,128,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
