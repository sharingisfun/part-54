It contains two of Manowar&amp;#039;s finest albums compiled into 14 tracks on one disc. I do not know when the compilation was released, only the dates for the individual albums. You may find out the date by looking at the scanned images. This is not directly from Russia. It was purchased in the United States, shipped from the United States, and ripped in the United States. What you are hearing is not Russian, but pure American heavy metal.\n\n\nUploaded to The Pirate Bay by blindead on July 3.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19de9e40b750f5b213512a28afa01bd6568e684d","amp;dn":"Manowar+-+Into+Glory+Ride+%2F+Hail+To+England+%5BMetal%5D+%5BImport%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19de9e40b750f5b213512a28afa01bd6568e684d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,222,158,64,183,80,245,178,19,81,42,40,175,160,27,214,86,142,104,77]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
