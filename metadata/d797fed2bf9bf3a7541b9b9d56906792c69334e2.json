Both bands experienced big international success in the 1970s. Before establishing a career as a solo artist, he was also a member of The Firm and The Law. He has recently toured and recorded with Queen.\n\nBad Company toured successfully from 1973 to 1982, and had several hits such as Feel Like Making Love, Can&amp;#039;t Get Enough, Shooting Star, Bad Company, and Run with the Pack. Rodgers also showcased his instrumental talents on several tracks: Bad Company and Run with the Pack featured him on piano; Rock and Roll Fantasy on guitar; and on the ballad Seagull Rodgers played all of the instruments. Bad Company earned six platinum albums until Rodgers left in 1982 at the height of their fame to spend time with his young family.\n\nThe summer of 2006 saw Rodgers again focused on his solo career with a world tour, which commenced in Austin Texas, U.S. in June, then on to Japan, finishing in Glasgow, Scotland, in October 2006.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d797fed2bf9bf3a7541b9b9d56906792c69334e2","amp;dn":"Paul+Rodgers+-+Feel+Like+Making+Love+%28Live+From+Glasgow%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d797fed2bf9bf3a7541b9b9d56906792c69334e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,151,254,210,191,155,243,167,84,27,155,157,86,144,103,146,198,147,52,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
