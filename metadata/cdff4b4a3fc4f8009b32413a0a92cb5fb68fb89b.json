The aim of this site is to introduce various characteristics of the Prophet Muhammad (saas) and how he behaved under particular conditions, because a Muslim needs to try to emulate his noble morality in every aspect of life. Allah confirms that in a verse: \nYou have an excellent model in the Messenger of Allah, for all who put their hope in Allah and the Last Day and remember Allah much.
