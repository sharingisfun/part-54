Great performances all around! Despite a few corny moments, the film does a great job of being genuinely funny. Chad does a good job, even better than in Freaky Friday! Jennifer&amp;#039;s kooky humor adds to the merriment as do the excellent supporting roles by Dan Byrd and Regina King.\nHilary is fantastic. She steals every scene! A truly remarkable, and talented young lady! The soundtrack is absolutely amazing! Including Hilary&amp;#039;s fantastic renderings of Crash World, The Girl Can Rock, Now You Know, and Anywhere But Here; Haylie Duff&amp;#039;s One In This World; and the smash hit Our Lips Are Sealed by Hilary Duff and Haylie Duff.\n\nA great movie for any age group. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98955d725fb33deafb049d9c40655be6c561544a","amp;dn":"A+Cinderella+Story+-+swesub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98955d725fb33deafb049d9c40655be6c561544a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,149,93,114,95,179,61,234,251,4,157,156,64,101,91,230,197,97,84,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
