After a quick installation, torrents with titles matching a set of keywords can be filtered by double-clicking in the torrent-table frame area.\n\nIn this first (and maybe only) version, the filter is triggered on the following words:\n\n'[spanish]', 'pctorrent', 'limitedivx', 'limitevcd', 'espa', 'firedivx', '[french]'\n\nwhich are the ones I personally would rather not see usually.\n\nThe matching is case insensitive. Next version may have functionality for adding/removing words, but until then it's possible to unzip the .xpi, changing the words and rebuild. DONT ask me how to do this. roachfiend.com has a how-to on Firefox extensions with all you need to know - follow that ==&gt; http://roachfiend.com/archives/2004/12/08/how-to-create-firefox-extensions/\n\nAnyone who would like to do further work - please do! Then tell me about your much-better-version so I don't have to update mine ;) A script that triggers on page load would be nice for example.\n\nTo The Pirate Bay admins: Wake the f*** up and get that dubbed section going!\n\nCompatibility:\n\nMozilla Firefox. Only tested with 1.0.3.\n\nInstallation instructions:\n1. Download tsi.xpi and open it with Firefox.\n2. Close Firefox and reopen.\n3. Done\n\nUsage:\nDouble-click in the frame where the table containing the torrents are.\nToggle filter ON/OFF by right-clicking followed by &quot;TSI&quot;, or click &quot;TSI&quot; in the Tools menu.\n\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b9d22d039dfd24398a3395f48acc77e19a8cbbb","amp;dn":"ANTI-SPANSHIT+extension+for+Mozilla+Firefox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b9d22d039dfd24398a3395f48acc77e19a8cbbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,157,34,208,57,223,210,67,152,163,57,95,72,172,199,126,25,168,203,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
