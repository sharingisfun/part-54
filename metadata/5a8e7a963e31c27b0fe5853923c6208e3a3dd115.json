Unzip, burn the CD-Image, install from the freshly toasted cd (dont mind the warning during opening them, the images are made with panther) use a serial from the generator when asked. For gameplay you will only need to mount the nocd-dmg.\n\nHere its running on tiger on a G4. There where never problems with it. Its compatible with the recently uploaded TFT-Expansion-Pack. I&amp;#039;ve tested it.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a8e7a963e31c27b0fe5853923c6208e3a3dd115","amp;dn":"Warcraft+III+%2B+SNGen+%2B+NoCD+Patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a8e7a963e31c27b0fe5853923c6208e3a3dd115","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,142,122,150,62,49,194,123,15,229,133,57,35,198,32,142,58,61,209,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
