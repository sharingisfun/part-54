Comments from Charles Shaar Murray:\n\nAround the time that Rock Drill was being recorded, Alex and Chris Glen played me a tape of &quot;No Complaints Department&quot;, a killer song which was one of the best things the band had ever produced, and I was eagerly awaiting the album so that I could hear it again. If you peel away the sticker that gives the track listing for the second side of this album, you&amp;#039;ll see that &quot;No Complaints Department&quot; was originally intended to be the final track on the album, a potentially great farewell to the SAHB.\nIt&amp;#039;s not here.\nInstead, the album signs off with &quot;Mrs Blackhouse&quot;, Alex&amp;#039;s well intentioned but ultimately fatuous song about Mary Whitehouse, a weak, ineffectual closer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4df5730a9fb53b67c2b23e8f84e4f2f4b69b2cb3","amp;dn":"The+Sensational+Alex+Harvey+Band-No+Complaints+Department","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4df5730a9fb53b67c2b23e8f84e4f2f4b69b2cb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,245,115,10,159,181,59,103,194,178,62,143,132,228,242,244,182,155,44,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
