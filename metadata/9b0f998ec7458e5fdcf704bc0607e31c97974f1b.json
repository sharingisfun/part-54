Length : 100min                \n\n\n The mysterious and charismatic Russian-born Nikolai Luzhin is a driver for   \n one of London&amp;#039;s most notorious organized crime families of Eastern European  \n origin. The family itself is part of the Vory V Zakone criminal              \n brotherhood. Headed by Semyon, whose courtly charm as the welcoming          \n proprietor of the plush Trans-Siberian restaurant impeccably masks a cold    \n and brutal core, the family&amp;#039;s fortunes are tested by Semyon&amp;#039;s volatile son   \n and enforcer, Kirill, who is more tightly bound to Nikolai than to his own   \n father. But Nikolai&amp;#039;s carefully maintained existence is jarred once he       \n crosses paths at Christmastime with Anna Khitrova, a midwife at a North      \n London hospital. Anna is deeply affected by the desperate situation of a     \n young teenager who dies while giving birth to a baby. Anna resolves to try   \n to trace the baby&amp;#039;s lineage and relatives. The girl&amp;#039;s personal diary also    \n survives her; it is written in Russian, and Anna seeks answers in it.        \n Anna&amp;#039;s mother Helen does not discourage her, but Anna&amp;#039;s irascible            \n Russian-born uncle Stepan urges caution. He is right to do so; by delving    \n into the diary, Anna has accidentally unleashed the full fury of the Vory.   \n With Semyon and Kirill closing ranks and Anna pressing her inquiries,        \n Nikolai unexpectedly finds his loyalties divided. The family tightens its    \n grip on him; who can, or should, he trust? Several lives - including his     \n own - hang in the balance as a harrowing chain of murder, deceit, and        \n retribution reverberates through the darkest corners of both the family and  \n London itself.
