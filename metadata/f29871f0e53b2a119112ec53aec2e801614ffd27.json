He combines\nhis media presence with actual physical activism, a practice that once led to\nhim being arrested on the personal order of George W. Bush! Alex Jones has\ngained international attention for standing up for what he believes in.\n\nFrom La Prensa to the Wall Street Journal and USA Today, Jones has brought the\ninformation war to the mainstream print media worldwide, speaking out against\ntyranny in defense of the Constitution.\n\nJones has interviewed some of the most amazing minds and the most intriguing\npersonalities in the world from guerrilla journalists to government officials to\nwhistle-blowing intelligence agents.\n\nThe Alex Jones Show is a hard-hitting news and information program unlike any\nother on the air. Jones is a seasoned investigative journalist who has broken\nhundreds of national stories during his career. He is an aggressive\nConstitutionalist who digs deeply into the facts to defend property rights, our\nnational borders, and the Second Amendment while he sends out a rallying call to\nthe American people to resist foreign entanglements and wars for corporate\ninterests. Jones eschews the bogus political labels of left and right and\ninstead focuses on what really matters: right and wrong.\n\nSunday, July 6th, 2008\n\nCRASHING THRU THE LIES..........Sunday\n\nListen to Alex&amp;#039;s Sunday Edition, a round-up of the week past and the week ahead,\nbroadcast from the studios of KLBJ AM in Austin, Texas. 4:00pm ? 6:00pm CST and\nsyndicated coast to coast.
