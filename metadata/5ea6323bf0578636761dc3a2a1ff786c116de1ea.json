It has been regarded as one of the most influential LPs ever made[1], being a tremendous influence on the psychedelic rock scene of the time and much of what followed. The album has whimsical lyrics about space, scarecrows, gnomes, bicycles and fairytales, along with psychedelic instrumental passages. The album celebrated its 40th anniversary on 5 August 2007.\n\n\n1 &quot;Astronomy Domine&quot; ? 4:12 \nLead vocals: Syd Barrett and Rick Wright \n\n2 &quot;Lucifer Sam&quot; ? 3:07 \nLead vocals: Syd Barrett \n\n3 &quot;Matilda Mother&quot; ? 3:08 \nLead vocals: Rick Wright and Syd Barrett \n\n4 &quot;Flaming&quot; ? 2:46 \nLead vocals: Syd Barrett \n\n5 &quot;Pow R.
