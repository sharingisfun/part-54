There they meet Professor Brett, whose revolutionary new computer WOTAN (Will Operating Thought ANalogue) can actually think for itself and is shortly to be linked up to other major computers around the world - a project overseen by civil servant Sir Charles Summer.\nIt transpires however that WOTAN considers that humans are inferior to machines and should therefore be ruled by them. Exerting a hypnotic influence, it arranges the construction of War Machines - heavily-armed, self-contained mobile computers - with which to take over the world.\nThese prove more than a match for troops, but by establishing a magnetic force field the Doctor is able to capture one of them, which he then reprograms to destroy WOTAN. Dodo, now back in her own time, decides to remain on Earth. The Doctor enters the TARDIS alone, but Brett&amp;#039;s secretary Polly and her merchant seaman friend Ben Jackson follow him inside just before it dematerialises.\n\nCast &amp; Crew\nCast\nThe Doctor - William Hartnell\nAmerican Journalist - Ric Felgate\nBen Jackson - Michael Craze from Episode 1\nCaptain - John Rolfe\nCorporal - Frank Jarvis\nDodo - Jackie Lane until Episode 2\nFlash - Ewan Proctor\nGarage Mechanic - Edward Colliver\nInterviewer - John Doye\nKitty - Sandra Bryant\nMachine Operator - Gerald Taylor\nMajor Green - Alan Curtis\nMan in telephone box - John Slavid\nPolly - Anneke Wills from Episode 1\nProfessor Brett - John Harvey\nProfessor Krimpton - John Cater\nRadio Announcer - Dwight Whylie\nSergeant - John Boyd-Brent\nSir Charles Summer - William Mervyn\nSoldier - Robin Dawson\nTaxi-driver - Michael Rathbone\nTelevision Newsreader - Kenneth Kendall\nThe Minister - George Cross\nThe voice of WOTAN/WOTAN - Gerald Taylor\nTramp - Roy Godfrey\nUS Correspondent - Carl Conway\nWorker - Desmond Cullum-Jones\nWorker - Eddie Davis\nCrew\nDirector - Michael Ferguson\nAssistant Floor Manager - Lovett Bickford\nAssistant Floor Manager - Margot Hayhoe\nCostumes - Daphne Dare\nCostumes - Barbara Lane\nDesigner - Raymond London\nFilm Cameraman - Alan Jonas\nFilm Editor - Eric Mival\nIncidental Music - stock\nMake-Up - Sonia Markham\nProducer - Innes Lloyd\nProduction Assistant - Snowy White\nSpecial Sounds - Brian Hodgson\nStory Editor - Gerry Davis\nStudio Lighting - George Summers\nStudio Sound - David Hughes\nTitle Music - Ron Grainer and the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, arranged by Delia Derbyshire\nWriter - Ian Stuart Black based on an idea by Kit Pedler\n\nHQ PAL VHS rip to DVD with Dolby Digital 2.0 sound with menu and extras\n\nName.........: Doctor Who - 27 - The War Machines HQ PAL DVD\nFilesize.....: 3.03GB\nRuntime......: 01:39\n VOB  MPEG-2 PAL DVD\n RECORDED IN SP\n Ac3 Dolby Digital\nAudio Bitrate: 48 kb/s (2/ch, MONO) 256K\nframe Size...: 720x576  [=4:3]\n\n\nCOMING SOON FROM &amp;#039;][&amp;#039;oP\n\nTHE TENTH PLANET WITH NEW RECONS FULL MENUS AND EXTRAS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a58403f52e96e015f22b6d654153e348463e9caf","amp;dn":"Doctor+Who+-+27+-+The+War+Machines+HQ+PAL+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a58403f52e96e015f22b6d654153e348463e9caf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,132,3,245,46,150,224,21,242,43,109,101,65,83,227,72,70,62,156,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
