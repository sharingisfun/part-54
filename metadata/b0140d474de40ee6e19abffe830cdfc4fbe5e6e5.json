The traditional shader simply fades from one texture to the next, creating ugly, muddy looking transitions in many areas. The new shader uses alpha information added to each landscape texture to mask the textures when they are blended with the textures below them, producing crisp beautiful transitions that give the illusion of much greater detail in texture application. WhatÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s more, this effect is achieved with practically no impact on performance!\n\nBefore and After Screenshots - http://omnichron.net/dt/index.php?page=comp\nDetailed Terrain ModderÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s Guide - http://omnichron.net/dt/index.php?page=guide\n\nBUGS REPORTS\n\nThis is the second phase beta release of this mod. Many issues identified in the first phase of beta testing have been addressed, but more are likely to come to light with additional testing. Please post bug reports in one of our threads:\n\nBethsoft - http://www.bethsoft.com/bgsforums/index.php?showtopic=811706\nCanadian Ice - http://canadianice.ufrealms.net/forum2/index.php?topic=8234.0\nTES Info - http://www.multimediaxis.de/showthread.php?t=104357\n\nKNOWN ISSUES\n\nIssue: Blood splatters on the ground flicker in some situations.\nStatus: These issues should be greatly reduced in this version.\n\nIssue: Some rocks are partly transparent when fading in to view.\nStatus: No practical fix is available for this issue at this time.\n\nCREDITS &amp; THANKS\n\nAlgorithm &amp; Textures: ChainsawXIV\nShader Implementation: Zeroed\n\nThe textures included in the core mod are based on the terrain textures in Qarl\\&amp;#039;s Texture Pack. They have been updated with alpha channels, normal maps that reduced tiling, and specular maps. QTP is not required to use this mod.\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nDetailed Terrain comes packed as an OMOD file, for use with Oblivion Mod Manager (http://timeslip.chorrol.com/obmm.html). This format allows for easy management of the mod\\&amp;#039;s content, and is also used to update the game\\&amp;#039;s shaders. You must have Oblivion Mod Manager installed to use this mod. Once you have OMM, follow these simple instructions:\n\n1. If you have the Beta I version of detailed terrain installed, you should be sure to deactivate it before installing this version.\n\n2. Double-click the \\&quot;Detailed Terrain (Beta II).omod\\&quot; file - it will open in Oblivion Mod Manager automatically.\n\n3. Select the mod on the list on OMM, and then click the Activate button. This will begin the process of unpacking the mod\\&amp;#039;s files.\n\n4. If you are using any version of QTP, youÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ll be prompted to overwrite files. Detailed Terrain upgrades these textures, so choose to overwrite all the files.\n\n5. When everything is finished unpacking, you\\&amp;#039;re done. Simply click on the Launch Oblivion button to play.\n\nVERSION NOTES\n\nVersion 0.4 ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ Beta II ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ February 25, 2008\n- Adjusted all landscape normal maps to eliminate the appearance of tiling.\n- Added specular data for many textures that were missing this information.\n- Fixed some missing mip-maps that were appearing as black at oblique angles.\n- Blood splatters should no longer be masked by the terrain masks under them.\n- Incidents of flickering blood splatters should be significantly reduced.\n- The mod now modifies fewer shaders, reducing potential future conflicts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0140d474de40ee6e19abffe830cdfc4fbe5e6e5","amp;dn":"TES4%3A+Oblivion+Mod+-+Detailed+Terrain+%28Beta+II%29+-+Version+0.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0140d474de40ee6e19abffe830cdfc4fbe5e6e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,20,13,71,77,228,14,230,225,154,191,254,131,12,223,196,251,229,230,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
