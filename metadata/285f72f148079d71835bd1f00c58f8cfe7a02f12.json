Tired of running, Kimble hopes to lie low in Santa Barbara and finally confides in Karen and shares his secret. But Gerard tracks Kimble to Santa Barbara from a single clue that Kimble leaves behind at the L.A. County Jail: a match with the word &quot;sails&quot; printed on it. When Kimble discovers that Gerard has arrived in town looking for him, Kimble and Karen, with the assistance of Eric, flee by sailboat and hope to end the running by faking his and Karen&amp;#039;s death in a sailboat accident during a storm at sea.
