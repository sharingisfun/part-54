When challenged to a drag, the women accept, but are forced off of a bridge. It appears that all are drowned, until Mary, quite some time later, amazingly emerges from the river. After recovering, Mary accepts a job in a new town as a church organist, only to be dogged by a mysterious phantom figure that seems to reside in an old run-down pavilion. It is here that Mary must confront the personal demons of her spiritual insouciance.\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.SanctifyingGrace.org/public-domain/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.SanctifyingGrace.org/public-domain/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease Seed this one once you get it so I can work on other releases.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58d219ee469c7cd35618649388daeadd218584f5","amp;dn":"Carnival+Of+Souls+-+Public+Domain","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58d219ee469c7cd35618649388daeadd218584f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,210,25,238,70,156,124,211,86,24,100,147,136,218,234,221,33,133,132,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
