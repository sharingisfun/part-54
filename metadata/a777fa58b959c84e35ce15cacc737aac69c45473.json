DOOM 3 which is scheduled to be released in the second quarter of 2004 for Xbox and PC will take gamers on a trip through the terrifying depths of Hell with a level of visual realism never before seen in the series. Distinguishing its self from previous titles, the new DOOM will focus more on an engrossing single player experience. In addition to its frenzied FPS action, it will also scare the wits out of players as they tremble down dark corridors filled with gruesome zombies and monsters ready to attack from the shadows","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a777fa58b959c84e35ce15cacc737aac69c45473","amp;dn":"DOOM+3+XBOX+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a777fa58b959c84e35ce15cacc737aac69c45473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,119,250,88,185,89,200,78,53,206,21,202,204,115,122,172,105,196,84,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
