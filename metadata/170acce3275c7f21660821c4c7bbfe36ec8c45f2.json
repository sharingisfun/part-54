I like it.  I did this for myself because I wanted to see if all of the RESTORED VERSION hype was true...and you know what?  It is.\n\nFucking mind-blowing visual tits.  It's amazing what a fully equipped studio can do these days.  It looks like a movie that JUST came out.  If you compare it to even the unrestored version on DVD, you will STILL shit yourself at the difference in image quality.\n\nWhat better movie to encode with XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2?  Oh, and I didn't space out on including the .idx this time, so the subtitles are complete on this film...English and French, in VOBsub format.\n\nCheck this out...2 hours 12 minutes....700megs, not 1400megs.  Is there really an excuse to EVER make a movie into 2 disks? Take a look at the quality and then tell me if it's EVER worth it to make a movie in 2 parts.\n\n----\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2\nBitrate: 604 kb/s AVG\nAspect: 640x368 = 1.74:1\nAudio: English, 128 VBR Stereo @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: External (Optional): English, French - VOBsub Format\nRuntime: 02:12:10\nFPS: 23.976\n\n----\n\nIf you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:\n\nNow at Beta 2!\n\nhttp://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta2-04042005.exe\n\nFor top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn\non (Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of\nXviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.\n\nIf you have a slow computer, please turn off pre-processing.
