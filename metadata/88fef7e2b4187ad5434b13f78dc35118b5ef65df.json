It is based on the National Library of Medicine&amp;#039;s Visible Human Project and was developed by the team of scientists at the Universiy of Colorado that acquired the speciments and images that comprise the Visible Human DataSets?. The program is a portable resource that enhances the cadaver dissection experience with views and combinations of anatomic structures unavailable in the real world. It also provides users that have little or no access to cadavers with a virtual body containing over 2000 anatomic structures they can explore and learn from in a manner similar to cadaver dissection. The VH Dissector is a reference resource for life-long learning.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88fef7e2b4187ad5434b13f78dc35118b5ef65df","amp;dn":"VH+Dissector+Pro","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88fef7e2b4187ad5434b13f78dc35118b5ef65df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,254,247,226,180,24,122,213,67,75,19,247,141,195,81,24,181,239,101,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
