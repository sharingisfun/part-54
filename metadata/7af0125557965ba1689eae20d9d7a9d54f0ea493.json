With the click of a mouse, you&amp;#039;re connected to friends, family, and colleagues anywhere on earth. It&amp;#039;s just that simple. You talk clearly. For as long as you want. For free.\n\nAnd with inexpensive add-ons like Call In and Call Out, you can talk to any telephone, mobile or landline on the planet. \n\nAny call to a Gizmo5 user is free. No matter when, no matter where, no matter how long. Free. ThereÃƒÂ¢??s no monthly service charge. Nor is there a set up cost. Gizmo5 is free.\n\nDo you ever have to pay for internet calls? No. Again, Gizmo5 is free. There is no membership fee. Where are the strings? ThatÃƒÂ¢??s the point, there are none.\n\nThe only calls you could ever have to pay for are calls to offline phones, i.e. mobile phones and landlines. But with Gizmo Call Out credits these calls are cheap and easy to administer.
