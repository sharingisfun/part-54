After being drafted and completing basic training, you\n  are plunged into the steamy jungles of Indochina. Heroic ideals of fighting\n  for honor and country quickly fade in the face of the fierce warfare: there\n  is no glory in death. \n \n  As a rookie soldier, you must quickly learn the finer arts of jungle and\n  urban warfare to become a battle-hardened soldier and survive your first\n  tour of duty. \n \n  Your Base Camp forms the central focus for your Operations, with your\n  primary objective to pacify threats from the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese\n  Army (NVA). You will need to venture deep into the hostile Vietnamese\n  countryside to search out and destroy enemy troops and encampments. With\n  visibility low, potentially every bush and tree could be an enemy-hiding\n  place. Only by careful observation and hastily learnt war craft shall the\n  enemy be overcome. \n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a3d49265b0bec7dde66e60a1affaca9415b8714f","amp;dn":"ShellShock+Nam+67-MONEY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a3d49265b0bec7dde66e60a1affaca9415b8714f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,212,146,101,176,190,199,221,230,110,96,161,175,250,202,148,21,184,113,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
