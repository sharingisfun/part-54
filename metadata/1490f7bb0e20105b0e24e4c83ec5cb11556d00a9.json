They have been together for many years, and released many CD&amp;#039;s.  What makes this band so great is their incredible melodic instrumentation.  Deadofwinter is too great to explain verbally, so I recommend you visit their myspaceor purevolume (http://www.purevolume.com/deadofwinter) (if you go there and listen to the first track, &quot;If you&amp;#039;re sorry you wouldn&amp;#039;t have done it&quot;, it will change your life) to get a better sense of their sound.\n\nIncluded in this torrent is their CD &quot;The Indifference of Good Men&quot;, two tracks off of their rare EP &quot;West Consin&quot;, as well as an early press of their upcoming, untitled CD.\n\nThe Indifference of Good Men:\n\n1.  &quot;Maintaining a C+ Average&quot; - 2:53\n2.  &quot;Turning State&amp;#039;s Evidence&quot; - 3:24\n3.  &quot;To Be Held in Your Arms&quot; - 4:16\n4.  &quot;Lipstick Stains on Cigarette&quot; - 2:47\n5.  &quot;February&amp;#039;s Confinement&quot; - 3:05\n6.  &quot;Learn your ssn&quot; - 5:10\n7.  &quot;Utility Lion&quot; - 5:12\n7.  &quot;Maybe She&amp;#039;s Just Playing Hard to Get&quot; - 4:51\n8.  &quot;They Say You Never Really Know a Person&quot; - 7:14\n9.  &quot;[Bonus Track]&quot; - 6:10\n\nThe West Consin EP:\n\n1.  &quot;If you&amp;#039;re sorry you wouldn&amp;#039;t have done it&quot; - 2:59\n2.  &quot;The Picard Manuever&quot; - 2:41\n\nNew Album:\n\n1.  &quot;If you&amp;#039;re sorry you wouldn&amp;#039;t have done it&quot; - 2:59\n2.  &quot;Turning State&amp;#039;s Evidence&quot; - 3:27\n3.  &quot;Track 3&quot; - 2:48\n4.  &quot;Track 4&quot; - 3:00\n5.  &quot;The Picard Manuever&quot; - 2:38\n7.  &quot;Track 6&quot; - 3:26\n\nIf you like this music, and are anywhere in the midwest, PLEASE go see these guys perform.
