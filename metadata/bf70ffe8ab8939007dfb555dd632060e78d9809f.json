Incidentally, this album features Frank &quot;Blackfire&quot; Gosdzik of Sodom fame. Mille, Ventor, and Rob come back with their last true Thrash classic: &quot;Coma of Souls&quot;. Released in 1990 just before Grunge came and wiped Metal off the map, this alum is less brutal than Pleasure to Kill (second most brutal album ever) or even Extreme Aggressions, but contains the best leads Mille and Blackfire ever done.\n\nThe album starts off with a melancholic acoustic intro before kicking into high gear in &quot;When The Sun Burns Red&quot;, which is my favorite Kreator song. Their brutal, yet melodic, assault continues unabated with the title track, &quot;People of the Lie&quot; and the short-but-insanely-sweet &quot;World Beyond&quot;. &quot;World Beyond&quot; has a part in the solo that reminds of the Power Rangers theme song, you know the one that goes &quot;Go! Go! Power Rangers!&quot;. As with the rest of my Metal Classics the whole damn album deserves a listen and you can&amp;#039;t call yourself a Thrasher without listening to this.\n\nYou know the drill, 320kbps rip straight off CD (Side note: the booklet is missing the lyrics to the last four songs)\n\nBUY THIS ALBUM OR THE EARTH WILL TURN FROM BLUE TO GRAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf70ffe8ab8939007dfb555dd632060e78d9809f","amp;dn":"METAL+CLASSIC%3A+Kreator+%5C%22Coma+Of+Souls%5C%22","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf70ffe8ab8939007dfb555dd632060e78d9809f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,112,255,232,171,137,57,0,125,251,85,93,214,50,6,14,120,217,128,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
