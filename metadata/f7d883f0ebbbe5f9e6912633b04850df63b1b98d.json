As before, as with all the HD stuff (inc. Heroes S2) I have used the same settings on the same program.  I am guessing that the recent update to either iTunes (and Quicktime) and/or VisualHub that is getting a smaller files at the same quality.  If anyone can shed some light on this that would be great.\n\nHooghlyROCKS!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7d883f0ebbbe5f9e6912633b04850df63b1b98d","amp;dn":"Lost+S04E05+%7C+MP4+H.264+AAC+720p","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7d883f0ebbbe5f9e6912633b04850df63b1b98d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,216,131,240,235,187,229,249,230,145,38,51,176,72,80,223,99,177,185,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
