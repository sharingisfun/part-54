The album Electric Lucifer is one of my all-time favorite albums with a psych touch with electronic equipment.\n\nAlbums included in this torrent:\n\nThe way out record for children - 1968\nElectronic record for children - 1969\nElectric Lucifer - 1970\nTogether - 1971\nCaptain entropy - 1973\nThe witch&amp;#039;s vacation - 1974\nEbenezer Electric - 1976\nElectric lucifer (book 2) - 1978\nHaackula (unreleased) - 1978\nHush little robot - (Newly released compilation)\n\nI also include some artwork that I have found. Very low-res unfortunately. If someone happens to have the originals on LP och som high-rez scans I would really appreciate if you write a comment so I can have them. A high-res scan of the Electric Lucifer front cover is high priority. :)\n\n---------------\n\nPlease check my other uploads for more art-house, cult classics, sleaze and weird movies.\t\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb2372a5da728ad79e7bd07a6850fa51424326ae","amp;dn":"Bruce+Haack+-+10+albums+%2B+artwork","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb2372a5da728ad79e7bd07a6850fa51424326ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,35,114,165,218,114,138,215,158,123,208,122,104,80,250,81,66,67,38,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
