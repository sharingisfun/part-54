(by comparing your own to the one in this torrent based on file size and bitrate)\n\nI also included 2 programs: &quot;File Renamer Deluxe&quot; &amp; Piston&amp;#039;s &quot;Direct WAV MP3 Splitter&quot; for obvious reasons. \n\nAll files are named properly: [Track number] - [Possible series name] - [Book title].mp3 \n\nAs you can see on this list,    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_Audio_Books&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_Star_Wars_Audio_Books&lt;/a&gt;\nThis torrent contains all the books for this Era.\n\nIf anyone has &amp;#039;The Truce at Bakura&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;Bounty Hunter Wars 3 - Hard Merchandise&amp;#039; on an original format, please rip this and contact me in the comments.\n\nI suggest you bookmark my account (http://thepiratebay.se/user/Starkiller20/) to stay up to date easily. \n\nFeel free to ask questions or criticize.\nI read the comments and will get back to you as soon as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3cd2b743e2678ca5530181fa49938c73a0313434","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+audio+books+-+New+Jedi+Order+Era","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3cd2b743e2678ca5530181fa49938c73a0313434","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,210,183,67,226,103,140,165,83,1,129,250,73,147,140,115,160,49,52,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
