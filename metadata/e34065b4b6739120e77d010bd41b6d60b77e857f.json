Ladies and Gentlemen\n2. Third Degree\n3. Wrecking Ball\n4. The Wild\n5. Mirror\n\n\nThe Synaesthetic was formed in the spring of 2004 from members of two local bands. The Synaesthetic were looking to bring original melodic and aggressive music to a scene dominated by mainstream pop and post-punk. Due to their wide range of influences and open concept song writing, The Synaesthetic have managed to appeal to a wide variety of fans without settling into a restrictive genre. In the coming months, The Synaesthetic will be releasing their second studio recording with the battle hardened producer Siegfried Meier. The much anticipated &quot;Locomotive&quot; EP will prove to listeners that The Synaesthetic are not only a wild and hard hitting original band, but also have a strong song writing sensibility that seeks to shake the foundations of the North American rock scene. The Synaesthetic will be touring Ontario and Quebec in the coming months and are looking to expand into the United States as soon as possible, look out for their live shows coming soon to your town. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e34065b4b6739120e77d010bd41b6d60b77e857f","amp;dn":"The+Synaesthetic+-+Locomotive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e34065b4b6739120e77d010bd41b6d60b77e857f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,64,101,180,182,115,145,32,231,125,1,11,212,27,109,96,183,126,133,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
