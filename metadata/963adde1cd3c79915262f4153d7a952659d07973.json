Each short, or segments, are written by Josh Olson, David Goyer, Brian Azzarello, Greg Rucka, Jordan Goldberg and Alan Burnett. Each segment has its own writing and artistic style, just as the works from the DC Universe. The six films all star Kevin Conroy, reprising his role as Batman from the DC Animated Universe.\n\nThe film uses a Japanese anime style for the animation. It is similar to another tie-in, The Animatrix, as both are collections of short films of Japanese origin. It is the third in the line of DC Universe Original Animated Movies released by Warner Premiere and Warner Bros. Animation; with the first two releases being Superman: Doomsday, Justice League: The New Frontier, and the next release following will be Wonder Woman. Though it is officially rated PG-13 for stylized violence, including some bloody images, it is not the first animated Batman film to be rated PG-13 (that claim goes to the uncut version of Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker ). This film is notable for being the first DC Original Animated movie to have a connection with another Batman media. While Superman Doomsday and Justice League: New Frontier have been released in the United Kingdom with a 12 rating, Batman: Gotham Knight is being accompanied with a 15 certificate\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://images.amazon.com/images/P/B001614E68.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://images.amazon.com/images/P/B001614E68.01.LZZZZZZZ.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:963adde1cd3c79915262f4153d7a952659d07973","amp;dn":"Batman+Gotham+Knight+%28DVD+Rip+XviD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"963adde1cd3c79915262f4153d7a952659d07973","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,58,221,225,205,60,121,145,82,98,244,21,61,122,149,38,89,208,121,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
