As well\nastheCareerchallenge,you'll be able to jump staight into a 4WD\nchampionship,takeonasingle rally or individual stage, and then\ntake on the world in online rallies with up to 8 players.\n\nThe all-new stages feature interactive scenery,so if you push too hard\nand hit a tree(or when, to be more accurate),you'll see it shudder\nfrom the impact and drop leaves from the branches.Collisions will also\nresult in a dazed effect, where your vision will be blurred for a very\nshort period from impact. On the subject of vision, bonnet cam is back\nforallthosewholike to gaze down on a pristine engine cover (if\nthingsaregoingwell),or the painstakingly detailed under-bonnet\nengine models (if they aren't).\n\nThe acclaimed Colin McRae Rally damage engine has been updated so even\nlight touches can scratch the paintwork-and as usual,panelsand\ncomponents can be deformed and removed in a realistic manner,showing\nthe mechanical components of the car in extreme detail.\n\nwww.codemasters.com/colinmcrae2005\n\n1.
