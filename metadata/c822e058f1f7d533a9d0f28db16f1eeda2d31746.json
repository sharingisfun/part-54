WWi contains updated and reimagined versions of the G1 characters and the combat is much grittier than the cartoon, so it has an &quot;Ultimate&quot; Transformers feel to it, much like Transformers: Generation 2 which was also written by Simon Furman.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c822e058f1f7d533a9d0f28db16f1eeda2d31746","amp;dn":"Transformers+-+War+Within+complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c822e058f1f7d533a9d0f28db16f1eeda2d31746","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,34,224,88,241,247,213,51,169,208,242,141,177,111,30,237,162,211,23,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
