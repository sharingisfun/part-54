It was such a drastic change from what Garth had been doing. The whole feel of it was a lot peppier, but somehow he managed to keep it from sounding the least bit corny. The sad songs on here are really sad, but it's mostly upbeat stuff. &amp;quot;Do What You Gotta' Do&amp;quot; was a hard-hitter. &amp;quot;I Don't Have To Wonder&amp;quot; has to be one of the saddest songs I've ever heard. &amp;quot;Belleau Wood&amp;quot; is a beautiful song, for those who haven't heard it. A lot of these songs made it to radio, but they're still worth having on CD. Seven was a lucky number indeed for the Garth man.\n\nGarth Brooks\nSevens (1997)\nCD to mp3 @ 320 kbps + covers\nApprox 105Mb\n\nTrax\n1. Longneck Bottle        \n2.
