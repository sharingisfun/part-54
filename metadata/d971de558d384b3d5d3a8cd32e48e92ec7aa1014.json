SoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¦ you now have that much information. They\\&amp;#039;ve been friends for years. They all eat foodstuffs. Still reading? Oh, ok. \n\nMarc Sherlock, (drums), Stephen Streit, (bass), and Chris Charlton, (vocals), have been writing music together since 1994. They experienced a good amount of success in an experimental industrial rock band called Levelnine. They toured the East Coast, were nominated for a couple local music awards, and managed to support themselves on a small scale via t-shirt and CD sales until 2003, when the band split up. During their tenure, Levelnine found common ground and a common crowd with another Cincinnati-based band, Dropshadow. \n\nDropshadow guitarist Tim Kindberg recalls those earlier years: \\&quot;Yeah, I remember those guys\\&quot; \n\nEventually Dropshadow members also went their separate ways. Tim Kindberg set sail for Florida, where he attended college and graduated with honors. His return to Cincinnati in 2004 coincided perfectly with a semi-Levelnine reunion. Marc, Steve and Chris had started to pick up the pieces of their former band and began concentrating on a completely new project. They contacted Tim and dragged him into the mix. (They told him they had candy.) \n\n\\&quot;We were determined to write music together, and not force it to be a specific style. We just let it flow out of us and it became what it is on its own,\\&quot; says singer, Chris Charlton. \n\nTheir unique style of rock is truly their own signature. Sometimes blending with jazz or blues, and always with a cutting, dark edge, The Host pushes the limits of modern alternative rock. Exotic verses and powerful choruses support a foundation of solid hooks that sink in and don\\&amp;#039;t let go. \n\nSince their debut EP, \\&quot;Receive\\&quot;, became available, the response has been overwhelmingly positive. With a sequel EP, \\&quot;Transmit\\&quot;, in the works, The Host has been busier than ever before. Live shows are now being booked all over the country, and if the initial response is any indicator, \\&quot;Receive\\&quot; will continue turning heads, and rocking fans of all ages, shapes and sizes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d971de558d384b3d5d3a8cd32e48e92ec7aa1014","amp;dn":"The+Host+-+Transmit+%28retail+320+kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d971de558d384b3d5d3a8cd32e48e92ec7aa1014","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,113,222,85,141,56,75,61,93,58,140,211,46,72,233,46,199,170,16,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
