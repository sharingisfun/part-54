GAME.TYPE ........: War \n\n                          \n  Tin Soldiers: Alexander the Great is pioneering many new and exciting \n  features. Favoring the grandeur and hand crafted look of miniature figures \n  we are eschewing the current gaming trend toward ultra realism. Our artists \n  spend their time drawing hundreds of individually adorned soldiers rather \n  than countless hours animating clones of identically clad animations \n  scratching their backsides! The game plays like a beautiful miniatures battle \n  from the historical units down to the table terrain, but with the advantages \n  of a computer opponent and a more dynamic turn structure. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d3e4a7efd822ea194d8160071807565aceac8dc","amp;dn":"Tin.Soldiers.Alexander.The.Great-RELOADED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d3e4a7efd822ea194d8160071807565aceac8dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,62,74,126,253,130,46,161,148,216,22,0,113,128,117,101,172,234,200,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
