Anyway, I'd like to think that having done lowpass filtering digitally could be better than having done none.\nCD versions of these tracks are awfully mastered, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war\nAnyway it sounds great for me, and it has no clipping, so sound should be better than from CD version.\nPhotos of cover and labels are included.\nReleased by parafin.\n\nTracklist:\n01-Personal Jesus (Boyz Noize Rework).flac\n02-Never Let Me Down Again (Digitalism Remix).flac\n03-Everything Counts (Oliver Huntemann &amp; Stephan Bodzin Dub).flac\n04-People Are People (Underground Resistance Remix).flac\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14ced5525cd4443e34cb4d0145912900f0f122c6","amp;dn":"Depeche+Mode+-+L12BONG39+-+Martyr+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14ced5525cd4443e34cb4d0145912900f0f122c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,206,213,82,92,212,68,62,52,203,77,1,69,145,41,0,240,241,34,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
