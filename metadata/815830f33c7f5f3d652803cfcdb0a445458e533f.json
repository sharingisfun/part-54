It is my belief that this movie is perhaps the most important movie of this age. As it is easy to understand by the average individual and it gives the spark to most people to do their own research into the subjects. \n\nGoal of the movie: to inform the public of the danger that exists that the world is moving towards a totalitarian global state.\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSoftware\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIn this torrent you will find Iso-burner, which is a freeware ISO-burning program.\nAlso, you will find Magicdisc, which is a freeware virtual drive program to watch and run the included ISO files directly on your computer without first burning them.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI will SEED this torrent as long as I can possibly afford. My upload isn&amp;#039;t that high (2 Mbit/s) so I hope you guys will SEED this as much as possible. \n\nI thank you very much,\n\nThe revolution is NOW!\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:815830f33c7f5f3d652803cfcdb0a445458e533f","amp;dn":"Zeitgeist+the+movie+-+Multilanguage+-+NTSC+%28American%2C+Asia+users","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"815830f33c7f5f3d652803cfcdb0a445458e533f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,88,48,243,60,127,95,61,101,40,3,207,205,176,164,69,69,142,83,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
