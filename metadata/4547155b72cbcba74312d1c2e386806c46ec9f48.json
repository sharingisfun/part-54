A real mindblowing visual and mental experience, with some really twisted sick moments. Yasuzo Masumura crafted a timeless masterpiece with this movie, one of those movies which was so ahead of its time that it still retains its freshness all these years.\n\nA lengthly review can be read here: http://www.dvdcult.com/rev_BlindBeast.htm\n\nShout outs and greetings \n\nGreat big thanks to the crew and uploaders at FSS, FSC and PB.\n\n\nICHI? \nAre you also just a regular pirate that now and then rip stuff to share with others?
