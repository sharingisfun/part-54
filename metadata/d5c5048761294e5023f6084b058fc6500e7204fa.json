Griffith based on the play Way Down East, written by Lottie Blair Parker. The picture stars Lillian Gish and Richard Barthelmess.\n\nIn the film, Lillian Gish is a naive country girl that is tricked into a sham marriage by a wealthy womanizer, then must rebuild her life despite the taint of having borne a child out of wedlock. \n\nAlthough it was Griffith&amp;#039;s most expensive film to date, costing him $175,000 more than 1915&amp;#039;s The Birth of a Nation, it was one of his most commercially successful films. Way Down East is the fourth highest grossing silent film in cinema history, taking in more than $5,000,000 at the box office in 1920.\n\nIMDB: 8.2/10\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0011841/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0011841/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5c5048761294e5023f6084b058fc6500e7204fa","amp;dn":"Way+Down+East+%281920%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5c5048761294e5023f6084b058fc6500e7204fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,197,4,135,97,41,78,80,35,246,8,75,5,143,198,80,14,114,4,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
