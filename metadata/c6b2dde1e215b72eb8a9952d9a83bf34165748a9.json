While every noob over the weekend was\nleeching the horrible iTunes reencode from their favorite torrents, we were\njust awaiting the wonderful CD, with proper cuesheets :)\n\n\nAmsterdam 08 follows in the footsteps of Miami 05 and Ibiza 06, and\nMarkus Schulz couldn't be happier about its origins - Amsterdam is his\nspiritual home thanks to the overwhelming passion of the people resident\nthere. &quot;I always choose cities that are dear to me for my annual mix\ncompilation&quot; says Markus. &quot;I just love Amsterdam, I feel a real\nconnection there - my friends there are like my family. The people of\nHolland were one of the first to embrace and accept me and my sound, so\nit was the natural choice to do the 08 mix there.&quot;\n\nMarkus' brand of dark, melodic trance is in demand the world over; his\nweekly Global DJ Broadcast radio show is now syndicated to over 30\nstations worldwide, his shows have taken in everywhere from Australia to\nRussia, China to Trinidad, and many other destinations along the way, and\n2008 is set to bring more dates in Australia, as well as Asia and South\nAmerica. Amsterdam 08 is a must-have album for dance fans everywhere, and\ncomprises Markus' top tracks from 2007 and hot tips for 2008. &quot;I really\nenjoy putting the compilation CDs together,&quot; says Markus, &quot;they're always\na total labour of love and are in my mind all the time. All year I'll\nhold back tracks that are just gems for the mix; I'll play them out here\nand there over the summer but I'll save them for the CD. Amsterdam 08\nopens a little differently - CD1 starts quite slow by trance standards:\n124 bpm, so it sets the mood, similar to when I'm playing extended sets.\nThe atmosphere builds up so that when you get to CD2 it's full on,\nmiddle-of-a-set tempotrance.&quot;\n\nMarkus, who also runs his own Coldharbour label, is often in Amsterdam\nfor club dates and regularly plays for Armada Music's events and\nfestivals. &quot;I really feel part of this city, it's so special for me&quot; he\nsays. &quot;This CD is a thank you to everyone there who has supported me over\nthe years, and I hope it becomes a special selection of tunes to everyone\nwho hears it.&quot;\n\nPLEASE BE PATIENT BT SLOW ME DOWN ON P2P SOMETIMES\n\n                 ENJOY Busker\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nThe comments below were directed at an idiot who posted really bad comments,\nand it looks like he has been banned for some reason or another,all his torrents have been removed along with his comments,so now you can ignore my replies.\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c6b2dde1e215b72eb8a9952d9a83bf34165748a9","amp;dn":"Amsterdam+08+-+Mixed+By+Markus+Shulz.TRANCEMASTERS.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c6b2dde1e215b72eb8a9952d9a83bf34165748a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,178,221,225,226,21,183,46,184,169,149,45,154,131,191,52,22,87,72,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
