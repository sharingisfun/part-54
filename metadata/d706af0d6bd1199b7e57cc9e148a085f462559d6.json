It&amp;#039;s one of my favourite synth plug-ins because it has so many excellent sounds and the clear GUI makes it very easy to use.\n\nThe retail version is provided on 6 CD-ROMs. I&amp;#039;m posting each one separately over the course of a few days.\n\nA keygen was included with Disc 1. An update to Atmosphere version 2.1 will be included with Disc 6.\n\nThe program cannot be installed without all 6 discs, so make sure you have them all. Please be patient for the initial upload, and seed for as long as possible for the benefit of all.\n\n--\nArty - &quot;I had too much to dream last night.&quot;\n22nd February 2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d706af0d6bd1199b7e57cc9e148a085f462559d6","amp;dn":"ArtyTorrent+Pack+81-Spectrasonics+Atmosphere+VSTi+Disc+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d706af0d6bd1199b7e57cc9e148a085f462559d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,6,175,13,107,209,25,155,126,87,204,158,20,138,8,95,70,37,89,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
