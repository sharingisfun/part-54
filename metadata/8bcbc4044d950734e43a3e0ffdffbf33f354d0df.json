Ben Campbell is a shy, brilliant M.I.T. student who -- needing to pay school tuition -- finds the answers in the cards. He is recruited to join a group of the school\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s most gifted students that heads to Vegas every weekend armed with fake identities and the know-how to turn the odds at blackjack in their favor. With unorthodox math professor and stats genius Micky Rosa leading the way, they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve cracked the code. By counting cards and employing an intricate system of signals, the team can beat the casinos big time. Seduced by the money, the Vegas lifestyle, and by his smart and sexy teammate, Jill Taylor, Ben begins to push the limits. Though counting cards isn\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;t illegal, the stakes are high, and the challenge becomes not only keeping the numbers straight, but staying one step ahead of the casinos\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039; menacing enforcer: Cole Williams. \n \nAlso Known As: 21 (Sony)\nBeat the House\nBeginner\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Luck\nBreaking Vegas (MGM/Ratner/Spacey)\nBringing Down the House: The Inside Story of Six MIT Students Who Took Vegas for Millions\nThe System\nUntitled Blackjack Picture \n \nProduction Status: Released \n \nGenres: Drama, Crime/Gangster and Adaptation \n \nRunning Time: 2 hrs. 2 min. \n \nRelease Date: March 28th, 2008 (wide) \n \nMPAA Rating: PG-13 for some violence, and sexual content including partial nudity. \n \nDistributors: Sony Pictures Releasing \n \nProduction Co.: Michael De Luca Productions, Relativity Media, Trigger Street Productions \n \nStudios: Columbia TriStar Motion Picture Group \n \nU.S. Box Office: $81,159,365 \n \nFilming Locations: Boston, Massachusetts, USA\nLas Vegas, Nevada, USA \n \nProduced in: United States \n\n\nMore info on http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0478087/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bcbc4044d950734e43a3e0ffdffbf33f354d0df","amp;dn":"21+DVDRIP+2008+-eng-+%28Hariwan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bcbc4044d950734e43a3e0ffdffbf33f354d0df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,203,196,4,77,149,7,52,228,58,62,15,253,255,191,51,243,84,208,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
