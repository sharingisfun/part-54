As an activist historian he is best known for his George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography (1992), a masterpiece of research which is still must reading. He is a 9/11 Truth Scholar and activist; AB Princeton 1966, summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa; Fulbright Scholar at University of Turin, Italy; and MA in humanities from Skidmore College. He is fluent in Italian, German, French, Latin and Russian. A decades-long expert on international terrorism, his 1978 study for the Italian parliament &quot;Chi ha ucciso Aldo Moro?&quot; (Who Killed Aldo Moro?) broke open the ownership of the &quot;Red Brigades&quot; by NATO&amp;#039;s clandestine &quot;stay-behind&quot; networks.\n\nGuest: Franco Maqui, Foreign Correspondent","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52999088cbae6a7caab40638339be90b8bcc4f8d","amp;dn":"World+Crisis+Radio+-+Webster+Tarpley+-+19+Apr+2008+-+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52999088cbae6a7caab40638339be90b8bcc4f8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,153,144,136,203,174,106,124,170,180,6,56,51,155,233,11,139,204,79,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
