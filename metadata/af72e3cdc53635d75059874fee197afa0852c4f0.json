Aged 10 he received    \n his first machine from his mother and father, respectively pianist and        \n drummer, a Juno 106 Roland. At that time, student at the Conservatoire, he    \n started looking at LFOs and filters. His favourite instruments remain         \n keyboards and especially the piano, an instrument which he will get back to at\n 13 when entering the Jazz section at the Conservatoire of Chamb?ry (73).      \n His growing interest for machines and electronic music enticed him to listen  \n to artists such as Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Pink Floyd, John Cage, Peter   \n Gabriel.                                                                      \n                                                                               \n Convinced that a fusion of styles is fundamental, Alex decided at 16 to look  \n into Pop-Electro fusion. He took part in several bands as keyboard player and \n arranger, his main function being to mingle and mix electronic sounds into    \n Pop-Rock atmospheres.                                                         \n After his Acoustic Engineer studies, Alex definitely made a turn towards      \n electronic music. While collaborating with different directors he got to carry\n out all types of orders. Original soundtracks for advertising, short films,   \n catwalk and even contemporary dance for which he wrote more than an hour of   \n music.                                                                        \n                                                                               \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.ultimae.com/en/composers/cell/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.ultimae.com/en/composers/cell/index.html&lt;/a&gt;                           \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.discogs.com/release/1013036&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.discogs.com/release/1013036&lt;/a&gt;                                        \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.ambient.us&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.ambient.us&lt;/a&gt;                                                         \n                                                                               \n ____________________________________________________ Psychedelic Cyber Zone __\n                                                            est. 2001          \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af72e3cdc53635d75059874fee197afa0852c4f0","amp;dn":"Cell_-_Live_at_Kumharas_Ibiza-WEB-2007-PsyCZ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af72e3cdc53635d75059874fee197afa0852c4f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,114,227,205,197,54,53,215,80,89,135,79,238,25,122,250,8,82,196,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
