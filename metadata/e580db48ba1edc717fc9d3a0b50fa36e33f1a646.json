He is best known for composing the music for &quot;Rule, Brittania!&quot; in 1740.  He was the most prolific and popular composer of his time in England.  \n\nThe &quot;Six Favorite Concertos&quot; for organ, harpsichord, or pianoforte were not published until after his death, in 1793,  but the first reference to their performance was in 1751 when his illegitimate son Michael played the solos.  Michael Arne later introduced Scarlatti&amp;#039;s sonatas to England. \n\nArne had planned to publish them and even wrote a preface for a subscription edition:\n\n&quot;To all Ladies and Gentlemen, performers on the Organ, Harpsichord, or Piano e Forte--and every skillful Professor, who liberally wishes to promote a work, which has been executed with the utmost attention, and is offered as an humble contribution towards their general endeavors to cultivate among their pupils an elegant and masterful stile of performance, which they can never possibly obtain, by employing their own and master&amp;#039;s time merely on puerile productions.&quot;  -Thomas Arne\n\nPerformers:\nRoger Bevan Williams, Organ\nCantilena\nAdrian Shephard, Conductor\n\nRecorded:  \nApril 12 &amp; 13, 1987 in Henry Wood Hall, Glasgow, Scotland\n\nEdition:\nThis performance was based on a newly-prepared version of the original 1793 edition.\n\nOrgan:\nThe organ was designed by Hendrik Karl ten Bruggencate and partially built by him in 1977.  It was completed by James A. MacKenzie in 1983, and he tuned it for this performance.  The organ has seven stops, is on a wind pressure of 2 5/8&quot;, and has a G compass.\n\nLabel:  \nChandos Records, Ltd. 1988;  Musical Heritage Society, Inc. 1989\n\nMaster:  \nDDD, total time 1:25:07, more or less\n\nThis rip: \n mp3 @ 320 kbps\n\nConcerto No 1 in C major\n1.
