Klein satirizes Jacques Cousteau, Borscht Belt comedians, mysticism, Watergate, and more with hilarious, educated sarcasm. Some of the topical references may have dated, but Klein&amp;#039;s savage, knowing wit has not. There are also more brilliant TV commercial spoofs, especially &quot;The Final Record Offer,&quot; a must-hear for anyone who&amp;#039;s been assaulted by tacky album ads from the small screen.
