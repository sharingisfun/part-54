Not only did he introduce me to the remastered Star Trek TOS, but also has uploaded Irwin Allen&amp;#039;s &quot;LAND OF THE GIANTS&quot; AND &quot;VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA&quot;, two staples of my childhood. Seeing these classics again made me think that Allen&amp;#039;s trifecta would not be complete without my favorite, &quot;LOST IN SPACE&quot;. Wracking my aging memory banks, I found a LIS file. Sadly, I have just one episode. But it&amp;#039;s the first, in all its B&amp;W glory. Wherein we are introduced to the Space Family Robinson, their loyal B9 robot, and the infamous comedic antihero Dr. Smith. Actually, he becomes the self-serving buffoon later. In the first, he&amp;#039;s plain evil!
