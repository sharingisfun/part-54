It is recommended to get the other pack first for a better experience. In the old one, there are two tracks in an album called &quot;Other FOTC&quot; and in this pack I added another song.\n\nThis pack contains the seconds part of a massive Flight of the Conchords library.\n\nThis pack contains more &quot;Radio&quot; content. We have 2 interviews on there. Plus there is &quot;The BBC Radio Series&quot; It&amp;#039;s a three disc set and this one contains Disk 1, disk 2, and disk 3.\n\nAlbums included are:\n\nMark Radcliffer Interview\nThe BBC Radio Series\nNPR Radio Interview\n+ A Bonus track, the filmed on a bus version of &quot;Phone 4 U&quot;\n\nFor song list, just check the file list.\nAll songs have album art tagged in. Meaning you put this in iTunes\nor Windows Media player and all the songs will organize themselves\nwith Album art and all. Plus I added backup hard copies of the art in jpeg format. Enjoy.\n\n\nI have purchased all the albums on this torrent, and am sharing them. If you like this artist you may condider purchasing their music.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTedM/Frenchflyingcows","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab9b4173e40e559a817e076c52facb6425eeff1d","amp;dn":"Flight+of+the+Conchords+Ultimate+Pack+%232+%28BBC+Radio+Series+icl%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab9b4173e40e559a817e076c52facb6425eeff1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,155,65,115,228,14,85,154,129,126,7,108,82,250,203,100,37,238,255,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
