Dubbed by the late Euronymus as &quot;the essence of pure black evil&quot;, Abruptum is only for those searching out the darkest and bleakest expressions of human emotion. All others: stay well away\n\n\nThis is my first torrent so please excuse any incompetence on my part.  I tried \nEAC but couldn&amp;#039;t get it to flac, so I just just used the Free CD Music Converter set to Level 8 FLAC.  There is no log, but It is Ripped to flac from a fresh store-bought CD.  If you like it check out Southern Lord Records for great (but not free) doom and black metal.\n\nI have a crappy 1.5 mbs connection so it will take a while to get going.\n\nPlease dont let this torrent die.  It sucks when UG Metal goes to waste.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ddee653ed28a4ef006e6b358f86cf3daafcecd15","amp;dn":"Abruptum+Evil+Genius+Flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ddee653ed28a4ef006e6b358f86cf3daafcecd15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,238,101,62,210,138,78,240,6,230,179,88,248,108,243,218,175,206,205,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
