He also finds relief in several hundred embarrassing, fruity cocktails. \n \nFor anyone who has ever had their heart ripped out and cut into a billion pieces comes a hilarious, heartfelt look at relationships -- featuring Paul Rudd, Jonah Hill, Bill Hader and Jack McBrayer. \n \nPart romantic comedy, part disaster film, &quot;Forgetting Sarah Marshall&quot; is the world&amp;#039;s first romantic disaster comedy.\n \nForgetting Sarah Marshall (2008)\n \nGenre: Comedy | Drama | Romance \n \nIMDB User Rating: 7.8/10 (20,765 votes) \n  \nDirector\nNick Stoller\n \nScreenwriter(s)\nJason Segel, Judd Apatow\n \nCast\nJason Segel, Kristen Bell, Mila Kunis, Russell Brand, Bill Hader, Kala Alexander\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nHTTP://DVDFILM.TV&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nHTTP://DVDFILM.TV&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85f231876c2dfafe7283eeeb239c4c9a6ead7e28","amp;dn":"Forgetting.Sarah.Marshall.R5.READNFO.XVID-dvdfilm.tv.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85f231876c2dfafe7283eeeb239c4c9a6ead7e28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,242,49,135,108,45,250,254,114,131,238,235,35,156,76,154,110,173,126,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
