A moderately successful TV actor living in Los \n       Angeles, &amp;quot;Large&amp;quot; hasn't been home to the Garden State in nine years. \n       But even with 3,000 miles between them, he's been unable to escape \n       his domineering father Gideon and the silencing effect he's had on \n       his son from afar. Stunned to find himself in his hometown after \n       such a long absence, Large finds old acquaintances around every \n       corner living quite unique lives as gravediggers, fast food knights \n       and the panderers of pyramid schemes. Meanwhile, at home, he does \n       his best to avoid a long-simmering but inevitable confrontation with \n       his father. By a twist of fate, Large meets Sam, a girl who is \n       everything he isn't. A blast of color, hope and quirks, Sam becomes \n       a sidekick who refuses to ride in his sidecar. Her warmth and \n       fearlessness give Large the courage to open his heart to the joy and \n       pain of the infinite abyss that is life.
