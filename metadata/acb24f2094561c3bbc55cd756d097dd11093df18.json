Inspired by the death of four family members from &quot;legal drugs&quot; Texas filmmaker Kevin Booth sets out to discover why the Drug War has become such a big failure. Three and a half years in the making the film follows gang members, former DEA agents, CIA officers, narcotics officers, judges, politicians, prisoners and celebrities. Most notably the film befriends Freeway Ricky Ross; the man many accuse for starting the Crack epidemic, who after being arrested discovered that his cocaine source had been working for the CIA. AMERICAN DRUG WAR shows how money, power and greed have corrupted not just dope fiends but an entire government. More importantly, it shows what can be done about it. This is not some 'pro-drug' stoner film, but a collection of expert testimonials from the ground troops on the front lines of the drug war, the ones who are fighting it and the ones who are living it.\n\nGeneral Info\nFormat                       : MPEG-4\nFormat/Info                  : ISO 14496-1 version 2\nFormat/Family                : MPEG-4\nFile size                    : 549 MiB\nPlayTime                     : 2h 1mn\nBit rate                     : 630 Kbps\nStreamSize                   : 2.04 MiB\nWriting application          : HandBrake 0.9.2 2008022300\n\nVideo Info\nCodec                        : AVC\nCodec/Family                 : AVC\nCodec/Info                   : H.264 (3GPP)\nPlayTime                     : 2h 1mn\nBit rate                     : 500 Kbps\nWidth                        : 640 pixels\nHeight                       : 480 pixels\nDisplay Aspect ratio         : 4/3\nFrame rate                   : 23.976 fps\nMinimum frame rate           : 23.976 fps\nMaximum frame rate           : 23.988 fps\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)           : 0.068\nStreamSize                   : 436 MiB\n\n\nAudio Info\nCodec                        : AAC LC\nCodec/Family                 : AAC\nCodec/Info                   : AAC Low Complexity\nPlayTime                     : 2h 1mn\nBit rate mode                : VBR\nBit rate                     : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)                   : 2 channels\nChannel positions            : L R\nSampling rate                : 48 KHz\nResolution                   : 16 bits\nStreamSize                   : 111 MiB\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acb24f2094561c3bbc55cd756d097dd11093df18","amp;dn":"American+Drug+War+-+DVDRip+-+iPod","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acb24f2094561c3bbc55cd756d097dd11093df18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,178,79,32,148,86,28,59,188,85,205,117,109,9,125,209,16,147,223,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
