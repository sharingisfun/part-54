Lights Out\n2. Up\n3. Lorraine\n4. A Foggy Day\n5. Kerplunk\n6. Inding\n\n\nCertainly the freshest of Jackie McLean&amp;#039;s early albums recorded for the Prestige label. There is a wonderful lightness and fluidity to all the tracks, even the protracted slow blues &quot;Lights Out&quot; that opens the album and sets the mood for the tunes to follow. Donald Byrd seems to feel particularly comfortable here, giving one of his best performances. The rhythm section -- Elmo Hope, Doug Watkins, Art Taylor -- is wonderfully tight. McLean himself is still somewhat caught up in the bebop idiom, but he already possesses the spark that sets this performance apart from the other Charlie Parker disciples. A very rewarding listen.\n\n(Review by hprill from RateYourMusic.com)\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07f6d30ef329a7965a9d62c39816468cda7b05f5","amp;dn":"Jackie+McLean+-+Lights+Out%21%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07f6d30ef329a7965a9d62c39816468cda7b05f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,246,211,14,243,41,167,150,90,157,98,195,152,22,70,140,218,123,5,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
