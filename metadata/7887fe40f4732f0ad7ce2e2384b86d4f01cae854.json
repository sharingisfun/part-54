Here it showcases Jeff&amp;#039;s harmonica playing and Mike does some interesting things with the acoustic guitar to get a chunky rhythm going. &quot;Still Lost&quot; soars whether it has a full band playing. Just hearing Margo sing the opening lines is soothing.\n\nYou can decode the Lossless audio FLAC files into WAV files with your favorite decoder ( see http://flac.sourceforge.net/ ) then write them to a CD with no gaps between the tracks (i.e. Disk At Once) for a complete &quot;Live&quot; show.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7887fe40f4732f0ad7ce2e2384b86d4f01cae854","amp;dn":"2007-03-19+Cowboy+Junkies+%40+Cafe+de+la+Danse+-+Paris%2C+France","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7887fe40f4732f0ad7ce2e2384b86d4f01cae854","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,135,254,64,244,115,47,10,215,206,46,35,132,184,109,79,1,202,232,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
