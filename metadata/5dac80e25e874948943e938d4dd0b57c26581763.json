More information at http://meetthegimp.org\n\n\nToday IÃƒÂ¢??ll start a series about mono- chrome or black and white conversion of digital images. ItÃƒÂ¢??s a new topic for me - so I start with a bit of background, some images from the Masters and a bit about the easy ways to make a quick conversion by desaturation and tweaking the curves a bit.\n\nThe image here shows the output of the three options of the desaturation dialogue without further manipulation. From top left to bottom right: lightness, luminosity and average. Which is best? Depends on the image.\n\nIn the next episode IÃƒÂ¢??ll show you a better but more complicated way to do this with the channel mixer.\n\nYou can find the files used here on the Download Page.\nSome links\n\nIf you really want to know whatÃƒÂ¢??s behind the three options in the desaturate dialogue, go to the GIMP documentation. ItÃƒÂ¢??s math. ;-)\n\nThe images shown in the beginning of the podcast are from Wikimedia. They have a glorious collection of copyright free images from Ansel Adams and others.\n\nA gold mine is the ÃƒÂ¢??American MemoryÃƒÂ¢?? collection of the US Library of Congress, especially the images made for the Farm Security Administration. A must to check out - donÃƒÂ¢??t let the site design put you off.\n\nYou find the Focus Ring feed and the new Focus Ring at the Photocast Network. Check out the other podcasts as well, but stay subscribed to this one. ;-) \n\nThis work is licensed under a\nCreative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 2.0 Germany License.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5dac80e25e874948943e938d4dd0b57c26581763","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_032_Monochrome_1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5dac80e25e874948943e938d4dd0b57c26581763","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,172,128,226,94,135,73,72,148,62,147,141,77,208,181,124,38,88,23,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
