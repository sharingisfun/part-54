In Japan, they are simply gaijin. Taro is a Japanese-American who is gaijin as well, but he doesn&amp;#039;t look like the others, so he is never called gaijin. I have lived in Japan for about 3 years, and I can say that there are many similar stories that happen in Japan every day. I have read this book twice, and these stories made me laugh too much.\nHowever, many of the terms used in this book are outdated and the dialect used is &quot;adequate&quot; only in Tokyo, and truly obscene.\nA Japanese friend who is from Hokkaido and lives in Nagoya doesn&amp;#039;t understand some of the words used in this book.\nAs I have said, this book actually doesn&amp;#039;t improve your vocabulary, unless you want to be a Yakuza in Tokyo, but as other reviewer said maybe it encourage yourself to learn more Japanese because it presents many truly stories that happen even today.\nThey are 12 stories:\n-Alien Invaders.\n-The ABC&amp;#039;s of Japanese.\n-Street Jive.\n-Waiting at Hachiko.\n-Talking about people.\n-The gay life.\n-Hookers and Gangsters.\n-Disco City.\n-Foreign Drinking Holes.\n-After Hours.\n-Romance and Low life.\n-Talking about Sex. \n\n\nFor the cover\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.nihongojouzu.com/images/zakcover.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.nihongojouzu.com/images/zakcover.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37e5095c1a6b93e440569968920387770ab594f6","amp;dn":"Japanese+%28+The+real+Japanese+you+were+never+Taught+in+school%29+Za","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37e5095c1a6b93e440569968920387770ab594f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,229,9,92,26,107,147,228,64,86,153,104,146,3,135,119,10,181,148,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
