Previously, Bill Callahan (who for all intents and purposes is Smog) recorded half-finished vignettes that were held down by an excess of low-fi studio mud. Here, he slows everything down to a trickle (except &quot;Somewhere in the Night&quot; which positively rollicks along by comparison) and the leaky faucet of this doom seems to be unfixable. The deadpan basso-profundo delivery gets deeper over time as the nails of failure from each relationship are hammered in. The opener is &quot;You Moved In&quot; and rests as a bad omen. By the time of &quot;All Your Women Things,&quot; Callahan is constructing a dolly from his ex-girlfriend&amp;#039;s accouterments. Spooky. --Rob O&amp;#039;Connor\n\n\n--\n\n\nAll Files Tagged Correctly @ VBR kbps\n\n\n--\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97d28506fec4f84b6ab81406f9d3b0a348f32f4a","amp;dn":"Smog+-+The+Doctor+Came+At+Dawn+-+1996","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97d28506fec4f84b6ab81406f9d3b0a348f32f4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,210,133,6,254,196,248,75,106,184,20,6,249,211,176,163,72,243,47,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
