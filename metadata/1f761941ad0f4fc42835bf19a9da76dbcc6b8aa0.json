Chess Records was the home to seemingly every hot guitar player in the Chicago area, and many of them make their appearance here. Besides the usual label guitar hotshots (Muddy Waters, Jimmy Rogers, Chuck Berry, Bo Diddley, Buddy Guy, Lowell Fulson, Earl Hooker, Otis Rush, Robert Nighthawk, Little Milton), space is given to sideman work from legends like Hubert Sumlin and Robert Jr. Lockwood and great one-offs by lesser-known artists like Jody Williams, Danny Overbea, Eddie Burns, Joe Hill Louis, Morris Pejoe, Lafayette Thomas and others. It seems as if everyone recorded for Chess at one time or another, also explaining the inclusion of tracks by John Lee Hooker, Albert King, Clarence &amp;amp;quot;Gatemouth&amp;amp;quot; Brown, Lonnie Brooks, Hound Dog Taylor and Elmore James. If electric blues guitar's your thing, then look no further than this fine two-disc compilation. \n\n1 Anna Lee - Robert Nighthhawk 3:15 \n2 That's All Right - Jimmy Rogers 2:51 \n3 So Glad I Found You - Johnny Shines 2:29 \n4 When I Am Gone (Treat Me Mean and Evil) - Louis, Joe Hill 3:07 \n5 Walkin' the Boogie [alternate take] - Hooker, John Lee 2:36 \n6 Date Bait - Blue Smitty 2:37 \n7 Tired of Crying over You - Morris Pejoe 2:29 \n8 Sad, Sad Day - Muddy Waters 3:45 \n9 It Was a Dream - John Brim 3:03 \n10 Forty Cups of Coffee - Danny Overbea 3:12 \n11 Just a Fool - Eddie Boyd 2:42 \n12 Loving Man - Muddy Waters 2:30 \n13 I've Got a Woman - Howlin' Wolf 2:51 \n14 Reconsider Baby - Lowell Fulson 3:12 \n15 Give Me One More Shot - J.B.
