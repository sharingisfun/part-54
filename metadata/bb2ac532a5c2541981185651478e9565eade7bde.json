It contains 21 of the best tracks from the original OST and has 9 arranged songs that play during the game's anime cutscenes. These arranged tracks are definitely the highlight of the album and should please any fan of Chrono Trigger's music. They certainly illustrate the caliber of Mitsuda's musical talent. However, this isn't a complete OST; it's more of a &amp;quot;best selection&amp;quot; of songs from the game itself along with the arranged tracks. Unfortunately, the tracks are also rather short, considering that they're not looped. If you're looking for a full soundtrack to Chrono Trigger, I would recommend picking up the original, 3 CD soundtrack to the SNES game. However, the beautiful, arranged tracks make Chrono Trigger '99 a worthy purchase, an excellent selection of music that should satisfy fans of the game alike.\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - A Presentiment\n02 - Chrono Trigger\n03 - Peaceful Days\n04 - Guardia Millenial Fair\n05 - Wind Scene\n06 - Secret of the Forest\n07 - Frog's Theme\n08 - The Trial\n09 - Lavos' Theme\n10 - Robo Gang Johnny\n11 - Robo's Theme\n12 - The Brink of Time\n13 - Delightful Spekkio\n14 - Battle with Magus\n15 - Corridors of Time\n16 - Zeal Palace\n17 - Schala's Theme\n18 - Undersea Palacea\n19 - World Revolution\n20 - Epilogue - To Good Friends\n21 - To Far Away Times\nBonus Tracks\n22 - Chrono and Marle (Arranged Version 1)\n23 - Chrono Trigger (Arranged Version 1)\n24 - Ayla's Theme (Arranged Version)\n25 - Frog's Theme (Arranged Version)\n26 - Chrono Trigger (Arranged Version 2)\n27 - Chrono Trigger (Arranged Version 3)\n28 - Schala's Theme (Arranged Version)\n29 - End ~Burn!
