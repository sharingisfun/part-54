The globalists intend to gain, through any available means, total dictatorial control over all the peoples of the world. They cannot realize their goal if their would-be enforcers (police and soldiers) refuse to assist them in their treachery. His motto spells out this truth: \n\nIf police officers and soldiers will not enforce tyranny, it will never be enforced!\n\nTaken from the free GCN podcast, converted to .wav, commercials edited out, re-encoded to .mp3.
