BE PATIENT.\n\nI\\&amp;#039;ll upload it daily until it fattens up.\n\nMount that .iso in daemon tools or alchol 120 or such. Make it go. Go baby, go!\n\nI couldnay find these disks anywhere in torrentland, so I liberated them from my favorite corporate bookstore for our enjoyment and education.\n\nThank you, Adobe God, for that which we are about to receive.\n\nThis is my virgin upload (well, 2nd in a row), please lemme know if it works or not.\n\n***  Poweriso added a 13kb file, called .DS_Store, when I used it to make the .iso.\nThis file doesn\\&amp;#039;t show up when I use winrar to open the .iso, so I guess it\\&amp;#039;s something poweriso uses. I left it in case it\\&amp;#039;s needed. Just delete it if it seems useless, I guess.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da1f4a359063a7070995419eeae3bcd8730d39ef","amp;dn":"Adobe+Photoshop+CS3+Classroom+In+A+Book+-+ebook+%2B+disk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da1f4a359063a7070995419eeae3bcd8730d39ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,31,74,53,144,99,167,7,9,149,65,158,234,227,188,216,115,13,57,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
