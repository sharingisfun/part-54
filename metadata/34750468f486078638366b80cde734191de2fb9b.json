It is designed to use minimal computer resources while offering functionality comparable to larger BitTorrent clients such as Azureus or BitComet.\n\nThe program has received consistently good reviews for its feature set, performance, stability, and support for older hardware and versions of Windows. It has been in active development since its first release in 2005. Its name is commonly abbreviated &quot;Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµT&quot; or &quot;uT&quot;.\n\nOn December 7, 2006, Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµTorrent developer Ludvig Strigeus and BitTorrent, Inc. CEO Bram Cohen announced that BitTorrent, Inc. had acquired Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµTorrent. BitTorrent, Inc. has employed the code as the basis of version 6.0 of the BitTorrent client which today, in fact, makes it a re-branded version of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ÂµTorrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:34750468f486078638366b80cde734191de2fb9b","amp;dn":"%C3%82%C2%B5Torrent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"34750468f486078638366b80cde734191de2fb9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,117,4,104,244,134,7,134,56,54,107,128,205,231,52,25,29,226,251,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
