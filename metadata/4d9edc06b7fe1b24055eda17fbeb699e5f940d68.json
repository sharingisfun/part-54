I am impressed by the workflow and the overall appear- ance. The output in the video has some noise in it, but that was my fault.\n\nI had my camera set up to store a RAW and a JPEG image and have put both files and the camera profile into the companion file to this episode. Now you can try to get a better image out of the RAW file than the processor of a Nikon D200.\n\nIn a lot of discussions and tutorials you read the term ?lith? or ?lith film?. I found an old box with real lith film and take you back some decades while describing how I have worked with these sheets of plastic.\n\nThen I try to rebuild one of the effects that were done with lith film in GIMP. I just emulate the effect, but I am working on a process to really simulate the process done with film. You can find the file to this part of the podcast also in the companion file.\n\nHow did you like the concept of these two last shows? Not one monolithic block but several shorter segments? I want to offer a mix of different topics in each episode, covering different levels of experience and different interests. I?ll make some more in this style and put up a poll for you to vote.
