Somehow we figured we'd fix a lot of problems and send out another one =)\nMany things works better now, and some things now works which never did before.\n\nOverall, we're very happy with this version. Gueux'net guys have been helpful\nin every way they have been able to, testers have skipped sunbathing to nail \nthe last bugs on the list and just a few of our programmers know that it's \nsummer at all... (Don't tell them)\n\nWe are aiming high on the dotfifty engine now tho. 2 coders are putting in all \ntheir spare time into some massive UI system, 1 coder went to a monastery in tibet \nfor meditation and to find himself. ( altho someone said he went to Thailand instead )\nand a couple others are working on what ended up here with this textfile.\nEither way... what I mean with all this is that these releases is just our \nsteppingstone to what we really want. \n\n\n\nAbout video mode switching\n--------------------------\nTo avoid confusion, the runtime modeswitch changes EEPROM values, and \nreinitializes screen - then to overwrite with the previous values,\nleaving the screenmode as you selected till reboot).\n\n===============================================================================\n                                     NOTE\n===============================================================================\nThe EEPROM is an essential part of your Xbox. It contains all the information\nthe hardware needs to initialize properly. Manipulating the data contained in\nthis chip always involves a certain risk, as bad data, power failures and other\nelements beyond Avalaunch's control can interfere. Although Avalaunch creates\nbackups, and does everything in its power to ensure that your EEPROM is not\ncorrupted, we cannot and will not take responsibility for the data contained in\nyour EEPROM. Please use all EEPROM-manipulating features at your own risk.\n===============================================================================\n\n\nWe'd like to thank all our users, you've done a great job reporting those bugs,\nand keeping us on our toes with new feature requests :-)...\n\nSpecial thanks fly to bmbr for hosting and maintaining our web site, to D-Blood\nfor hosting and maintaining our bug tracker and the whole testing team for so\nmuch dedication to help us deliver a great release of Avalaunch!\n\nAlso thanks to modchipman for the logo contest prizes and no_remorse for the\ngreat Avalaunch jewels. You guys rock!\n\n- Team Avalaunch\n      (The Joker (TJ_CRS), ^Blazed^, lys, jjsmither (Devenic),\n                                      JbOnE, r0wdy, A_Snowman)\n\n\n===============================================================================\n                                   CHANGELOG\n===============================================================================\n\nAudio\n-----\nRemoved SDL\nMade OGG/Vorbis decoder codec.\nFixed the WMA codec so you can skip songs here now without having it change on it's own\n\nCore \n----\nYow can boot as a single file, little crashbug there\nCleared some xbe flags that allows ava to boot on empty hdd\nKeyboard up disables music control\nKeyboard doesnt mix in with settings menu\nvideomode/videoflags/audioflags/parental settings uses nothing but kernel calls now, still leaving in all security\neeprom key to unlock some keys tended to get zero'ed out after IGR on some bioses, so we put in the default one\nAdded a hddlock feature that keeps a secure backup of the keys, comparing them so it will only lock if keys match\nFixed so warning/info boxes can contain more than one line - esp made for eeprom warning and KAI onjoin\nremade the default bootlogo to a higher res so it looks a tad more slick\n\nFilemanager\n-----------\nfixed the weird shade on most resolutions\n\nKAI\n---\nFixed crashbugs when joining rainbow 6 and halo + more\nFixed the crashbug that occurs when you try to attach to KAI while it's already started at boot\n\nLanguages\n---------\nAdded Portugese language file (by GamerBR).\n\nQuickStart\n----------\nChanged path handling. QuickStart shouldn't be quite as picky on how you specify the paths anymore.\n\nScreensaver\n-----------\nscreensaver-x both loads and stays loaded now - as opposed to loads and being overwritten in memory as it used to\nchanged to reflection type mapping on the texture to make it a bit nicer-looking\n\nSettings\n--------\nFixed the IDE Master/Slave typo.\nFixed a keyboard priority error making keyboard look funny\nFixed XBFTP keyboard thumbstick by disabling music control if keyboard is up\nFixed the KAI username/password keyboard bug\nFixed KAI password/username info disappearing\n\nskins\n-----\nfixed a few allxboxskins-bugs in those archives where skins aren't compressed with dir\nMoved screensaver.x to skins ( but will still read the xbe-one/in the xbe-dir if nothing is located with skin )\n\nTelnet Client\n-------------\nKicks user to menu instead if entertaining it in an eternal loop if an error occures\n\nUpdater\n-------\nFixed a major problem within updating that would pretty much render it useless. ( make sure it really got updated to this one )\n( old updater might require you to delete olddash.xbe )\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c8ef24f7b9337594d021856fd64282ad87dfd0b","amp;dn":"Avalaunch.0.49.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c8ef24f7b9337594d021856fd64282ad87dfd0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,142,242,79,123,147,55,89,77,2,24,86,253,100,40,42,216,125,253,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
