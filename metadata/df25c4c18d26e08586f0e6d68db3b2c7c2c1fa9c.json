Sorry!\nExtremely rare 1992 release of Daevid Allen's 1967/1969 recordings. The 19 tracks were recorded in various French studios and locations over a period of time that starts right after Allen left the Soft Machine in the Fall of 1967 and ends in early 1969 with the first incarnation of Gong. All had remained in the vaults until 1992 when a French company, now sadly defunct, managed to talk Allen into releasing them. This is raw psych, sometimes reminiscent of Syd Barrett's 1968 solo recordings, that is to say songs with a weird edge.\nA lot of them saw the light of day in one form or another on AllenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s subsequent solo albums.\nBanana Moon : Je ne fume pas des bananes (unreleased recordings, 1967 /1968)\n\n1.\tIntro\n2.\tPretty miss titty\n3.\tRich girl\n4.\tUn oeuf for you\n5.\tMy motherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s gone to India / Hare krishna / Time of the green banana /  Remember the name*\n6.\tLa belle c&amp;eacute;r&amp;eacute;brale\n7.\tEst-ce que je suis (gar&amp;ccedil;on ou fille) ? \n8.\tHyp hypnotise you \n9.\tGoldilox\n10.\tWhy do you come knocking at my door ?\n11.\tRockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢roll angel\n12.\tWhy are we sleeping ?\n13.\tFrench garden\n14.\tFrench garden\n15.\tPretty miss titty\n16.\tPretty miss titty\n17.\tGong song\n18.\tJe ne fume pas des bananes (Pop Club 1968)\n19.\tJe ne fume pas des bananes\n\n*aka &amp;laquo; We did it again &amp;raquo;\n\nBanana Moon : tracks 2, 3, 4, 5, 12, 13, 14, 16, 18 (1968) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ track twelve being a live track from the May 1968 film mentioned above\n\nGong (Daevid Allen with unknown musicians, some tracks including Banana Moon bassist and/or drummer) : tracks 1, 6, 9, 10, 11, 15, 17, 19 (1967 / 1968)\n\nGong (Daniel Laloux- vocals; Christian TritshÃ¢â‚¬â€œ bass; Rachid Houari- drums; Didier Bad de Grass- sax; How wow wow- electric violin; Gilli SÃ¢â‚¬â„¢myth- space whisper; Divided Alein- guitar and local vocal) : tracks 7 and 8 (1969)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df25c4c18d26e08586f0e6d68db3b2c7c2c1fa9c","amp;dn":"ultra+rare+french+psych+%3A+Banana+Moon+%28with+Daevid+Allen+-+1967%2F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df25c4c18d26e08586f0e6d68db3b2c7c2c1fa9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,37,196,193,141,38,224,133,134,240,230,214,141,179,178,199,194,193,250,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
