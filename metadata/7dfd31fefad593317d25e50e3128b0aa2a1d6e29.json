Ostrander, a more politically aware writer, sought to make Firestorm more relevant to the world and a good deal grittier. His first major story arc pitted Firestorm against the world, as the hero (acting on a suggestion from a terminally ill Prof. Stein) demanded the U.S. and the Soviet Union destroy all of their nuclear weapons. After tussles with the Justice League and most of his enemies, Firestorm faced off against a Russian nuclear man named Pozhar in the Nevada desert, where both had an atomic bomb dropped on them.\n\nWhen the smoke cleared, a new Firestorm was created who was made up of Raymond and the Russian, Mikhail Arkadin (the Russian superhero Pozhar), but controlled by the disembodied amnesiac mind of Prof. Stein. The stories featuring this version of the hero were highly political, with a good deal of action taking place in Mikhail Gorbachev\\&amp;#039;s Moscow.\n\nThe Raymond/Arkadin Firestom proved to be a transitional phase, as in 1989, writer John Ostrander fundamentally changed the character of Firestorm by revealing that Firestorm was a \\&quot;Fire Elemental\\&quot;. Taking his cue from Alan Moore\\&amp;#039;s Swamp Thing (an earth elemental), Firestorm now became something of an environmental crusader, formed from Raymond, Arkadin, and a Soviet clone of the previous Firestorm, but with a new mind. Prof. Stein, no longer part of the composite at all, continued to play a role, but the focus was on this radically different character. New artist Tom Mandrake would create a new look to match. It was during this phase that Firestorm met and befriended Shango and the Orishas, the elemental gods of Africa. He also met their chief deity and Shango\\&amp;#039;s older brother Obatala, Lord of the White Cloth. This was also the situation in which the Shadowstorm entity first appeared.\n\nHowever, the series ran out of steam at its one hundredth issue, by which time Stein learned that he was destined to be the true fire elemental and would have been were it not for Ron Raymond also being there by circumstance. Raymond and Arkadin were returned to their old lives, and Stein, now Firestorm, was accidentally exiled to deep space in the process of saving the Earth. \n\nSeed and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dfd31fefad593317d25e50e3128b0aa2a1d6e29","amp;dn":"Firestorm+The+Nuclear+Man+v1+%5B1987-2000%5D+%28Catseye2001%29+%5Bh33t%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dfd31fefad593317d25e50e3128b0aa2a1d6e29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,253,49,254,250,213,147,49,125,37,229,14,49,40,176,170,42,29,110,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
