The Bratz, Cloe, Jade, Sasha and Yasmin will play Rapunzel, Snow White, Little Red Riding Hood and Cinderella, but the reality is that their hearts are not in it.\n\nThe Bratz girls feel that the fairy tale heroines are not strong-willed characters and that the Bratz Kidz are better equipped to handle the misadventures in the land of make believe. That is, until a little frog appears, and zaps them into Fairy Tale Land. There, the Bratz Kidz must prove that they can handle things better than the original characters, but quickly realize itÃƒÂ¢??s not so easy to battle characters such as the big bad wolf and evil stepmothers!\n\nBy working together as friends, they are able to get through each story and overcome every obstacle as a team! The trip to Fairy Land gives them a new-found appreciation for the classic characters they portray.\n\nThe Kidz soon agree that it isnÃƒÂ¢??t right to judge others until you have walked a mile in their glass slippers!
