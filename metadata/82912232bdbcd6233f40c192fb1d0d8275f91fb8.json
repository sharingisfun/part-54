And with this album they are emerging as true artists in the zero-boundary sense: cinematic storytellers whose albums come together in an essential whole, and players whose jaw-dropping performances on record make you yearn for the chance to experience their energy up close and in person. Red of Tooth and Claw finds Murder By Death at the height of their powers.\n\nTrack Listing\n1 1 Comin\\&amp;#039; Home\n2 Ball &amp; Chain\n3 Rumbrave\n4 Fuego!\n5 Theme (For Ennio Morricone)\n6 A Second Opinion\n7 Steal Away\n8 Ash\n9 The Black Spot\n10 \\&amp;#039;52 Ford\n11 Spring Break 1899\n\n\n\nbe kind, please rewind. this is my first torrent. ripped it myself.\n\ncheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82912232bdbcd6233f40c192fb1d0d8275f91fb8","amp;dn":"Murder+By+Death+-+Red+of+Tooth+and+Claw+VinylRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82912232bdbcd6233f40c192fb1d0d8275f91fb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,145,34,50,189,188,214,35,63,64,193,146,251,29,13,130,117,249,31,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
