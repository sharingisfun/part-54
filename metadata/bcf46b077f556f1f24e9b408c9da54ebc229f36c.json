The counter-economic strategies presented here are radical alternatives to classical capitalist economic organisation that exploit, or have been produced by, the existing global economic system.\n\nEssays by ten writers cover a wide cross-section of activity, from new approaches to intellectual property and the implications of the free/open source software movement to political activism and the de facto self-organisation embodied in informal architecture and the so-called black economy.\n\nSelf-organisation/Counter-Economic Strategies is not a comprehensive overview or an attempt to unify these diverse interpretations. It is intended as a toolbox of ideas, situations and approaches, and includes many practical examples.\n\n\nSelf-Organisation/Counter-Economic Strategies\n\nThis book is published by:\nSternberg Press (2006)\nProduced by:\nNIFCA, Nordic Institute for Contemporary Art\nIn collaboration with:\nThe Academy of Fine Arts, Helsinki\nThe Van Abbemuseum, Eindhoven\nMontana, Denmark\nEditors: Will Bradley, Mika Hannula, Cristina Ricupero, Superflex\nEditorial Co-ordinator: Sylvester Roepstorff\nCopy Editing: Christy Lange\nDesign: Rasmus Koch\nAssistants: Thomas Frederiksen, Alexander HÃƒÂ¤ggstrÃƒÂ¶m\nTypeface: Akzidenz-Grotesk BQ\nPrinting and binding: Centertryk A/S, Denmark\nISBN 1-933128-13-5\nSternberg Press\nCaroline Schneider\n1182 Broadway #1602, New York NY 10001\nLinienstraÃƒÅ¸e 159, D-10115 Berlin\nwww.sternberg-press.com\nNIFCA publication # 28\nUnless otherwise stated, the material contained in\nthis book is made available under the Creative Commons\nAttribution Non-Commercial ShareAlike Licence 2.5\n(www.creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.5/) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://superflex.net&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://superflex.net&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bcf46b077f556f1f24e9b408c9da54ebc229f36c","amp;dn":"Superflex_Selforganisation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bcf46b077f556f1f24e9b408c9da54ebc229f36c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,244,107,7,127,85,111,31,36,233,180,8,201,218,84,235,194,41,243,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
