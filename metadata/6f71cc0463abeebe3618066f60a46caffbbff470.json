Everything is now in the .7z file. \n- Jan 25/08 - Updated to Jan19-r23625\n- Jan 7/08 - Updated to Jan06-r23261 - HAPPY NEW YEAR!\n- Dec 14/07 - VMWare Image updated to Dec14th-Rev23122\n- Dec 9/07 - Updated the VMware disk image to Dec8th-Rev23077\n\n\nThe Haikuware.com (http://www.haikuware.com) Weekly SuperPack is a preconfigured VMware image of the Haiku Operating System with a whole host of software installed on it for testing. \n\nHaiku OS (http://haiku-os.org) is inspired by BeOS and is intended to be 100% compatible with BeOS when R1 is released. \n\n***Installation***\n\nAll you need to run this are the included files and a VMware product. You can get VMware Player or Server for free from http://vmware.com. \n\nThe apps.7z is the compressed vmware disk in 7-zip format. The haiku.vmx file is the vmware configuration file. Make sure both are in the same directory and double click the haiku.vmx file to run it.\n\n\n***More Info From Haikuware.com***\n\nThis is a 10gb expanding VMWare disk image. I plan to update the operating system on the image weekly so you can gauge Haiku&amp;#039;s improvements. Bundled with known compatible software, it&amp;#039;s the perfect way to test out Haiku&amp;#039;s capabilities!\n\nIt contains the Haiku OS (rev23625) vmware graphics, network and sound drivers, all the needed libraries, developer tools, all the menu links for the included applications, desktop background, etc.\n\nThere&amp;#039;s about 9.7 gb free space on it, it&amp;#039;s bootable, it&amp;#039;s maximally compressed to a file size of &lt;100mb (decompresses to ~400-450mb) and should be ready to go. Please use 7zip (included in Haiku) to decompress the image.\n\nHere&amp;#039;s a VMX file in case you need it. Use that file and the disk image and try it with VMWare Player (drop the disk image and vmx in c:/ for windows users).\n\nYou can easily convert this into a Parallels disk image using their &amp;#039;Transporter&amp;#039; or a disk image for Qemu by placing apps.vmdk in the same directory as (e.g) qemu-img.exe, and then executing this command.\n\nqemu-img convert apps.vmdk -O vmdk apps.img (Windows)\n./qemu-img convert apps.vmdk apps.img -O raw (OS X)\n\nYou can also move all your settings, applications, drivers, etc to a new Haiku revision by using Simple Backup on your home directory and then copying it to a new Haiku revision. The Haikuware superpack built everything into the home directory so everything is one place, and you can easily backup and restore your settings on a new Haiku revision.\n\nThe disk image contains the following applications/stuff:\n\nAudio:\nAi4\nColdCut\nMeV\nSamplestudio\nZenebona\n\nBooks (PDFs):\n\nPractical File System Design\nProgramming the BeOS\n\nCompression:\nBeezer\n\nDevelop:\nBeIDE\nCheckItOut\nClue\nCVS\nGCC-2.95.3-BeOS-061007\nHeaders\nJam\nJamMin\nMeTOS\nPackageBuilder\nPE\nSSH\nSVN\nYab &amp; YabIDE\n\nDrivers:\nVlance network driver\nVMWare Graphics Driver\nOSS Sound\nes137x audio driver\n\nEmulators:\nBeQ\nBeYame\nScummVM\nZSnes\n\nGames:\nMaelstrom\n2HOT4U\n\nGraphics:\neXposer\nExposure\nMojo (demo)\nWonderbrush (demo)\n\nInternet:\nBeGet\nBePodder\nBeShare\nFirefox 2.0.9\nJabber\nMac File Server for BeOS\nNetPenguin\nOpera (demo)\nRobinHood\nSilverWing\nTransmission\nVision\nRDesktop with GUI\n\nOffice:\nBePDF\nGoBE Productive 2.0 (demo)\nOpenSum-It\nInline Constructor (demo)\n\nOther:\nBe Converter\nBeeF\nBePC-Info\nCalc\nFilwip\nGraph\nSimpleBackup\nSome extra screensavers\n\nVideo:\nVLC \n\nVisit http://www.haikuware.com for more info!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f71cc0463abeebe3618066f60a46caffbbff470","amp;dn":"Haikuware+Weekly+Superpack+Feb9th-r23934","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f71cc0463abeebe3618066f60a46caffbbff470","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,113,204,4,99,171,238,190,54,24,6,111,96,164,108,175,251,191,244,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
