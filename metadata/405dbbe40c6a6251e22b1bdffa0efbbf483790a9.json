That means it is highly recommended (but not mandatory) to have and install this scenery too, so you can get the maximum benefit from ÃƒÂ¢??Grenoble IsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨reÃƒÂ¢?? AND increase the reality-level of your FS2004 to great heights for the region !\n\nGrenoble IsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re Airport is a sister airport of Lyon Saint-ExupÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©ry Airport. It is situated at the heart of the RhÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â´ne-Alpes region, one of the most populated regions in France. Its history begins in the Sixties, when it was built especially for the 1968 Winter Olympics. For a long time the airport has been called &quot;Grenoble Saint Geoirs&quot;, but in 2004 it was renamed as &quot;Grenoble IsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re&quot;, when a private enterprise took a concession to manage it.\n\nThe average annual number of passengers for the last 5 years is about 270 000. It has an annual growth of about 15%. Although there are not a lot of regular flights, in winter the airport becomes a busy place, receiving a great number of charter flights with passengers coming to enjoy skiing in the Alps. Grenoble IsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re also attracts some low-cost companies (like EasyJet and Ryanair).\nToday the airport has a runway of 3050 m and it can be used by almost all types of aircraft. The apron is able to accommodate ten medium range aircraft and some extensions are planned for future. You can also find a flying school (Aeralp) and a Center of aeronautics education (CEFA) at Grenoble IsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re.\nThe scenery of Grenoble IsÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨re airport for Microsoft Flight Simulator represents the airport as it was in summer 2007.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:405dbbe40c6a6251e22b1bdffa0efbbf483790a9","amp;dn":"FS2004+-+FSAddon+-+Grenoble+Isere+Airport","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"405dbbe40c6a6251e22b1bdffa0efbbf483790a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,93,187,228,12,106,98,81,226,43,27,223,250,14,251,191,72,55,144,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
