The movie is about a group of heroin addicts in late 1980s Edinburgh and their passage through life. It stars Ewan McGregor as Mark Renton, Ewen Bremner as Spud, Jonny Lee Miller as Sick Boy, Kevin McKidd as Tommy, Robert Carlyle as Begbie and Kelly Macdonald as Dianne. Author Irvine Welsh also has a brief appearance as hapless drug dealer Mikey Forrester.\n\nThe screenplay, by John Hodge, was adapted from Welsh&amp;#039;s novel. It does not contain any references to the non-drug-related hobby of train spotting. The title is a reference to an episode in the original book (not included in the film) where Begbie and Renton meet &quot;an auld drunkard&quot; in the disused Leith Central railway station, which they are visiting to use as a toilet. He asks them, in a weak attempt at a joke, if they are &quot;trainspottin&amp;#039;&quot;. As they walk away, Renton realizes the drunk was Begbie&amp;#039;s father (p309, Minerva edition).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33542ab03100671808f0d4320feaaba2b369cd04","amp;dn":"TRAINSPOTTING+-+%5BENG%5D%5B1996%5D+-+LIBRE+%26+VERITAS+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33542ab03100671808f0d4320feaaba2b369cd04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,84,42,176,49,0,103,24,8,240,212,50,15,234,171,162,179,105,205,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
