Vampires once ruled the night but have seen their numbers reduced by fearless bounty hunters. One such hunter is D, the halfbreed son of a human mother and vampire father. When a girl from a rich family is taken from her home by the vampire Meier Link, her father contracts both D and the Markus brothers (a rival group of hunters) to race to retrieve her. As the heroes fight their way through Meier&amp;#039;s hired guards, they begin to suspect that the girl may have gone with him willingly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1371de83188bad02982bc343cd6c6058fc4b1409","amp;dn":"Vampire+Hunter+D%3A+Bloodlust","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1371de83188bad02982bc343cd6c6058fc4b1409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,113,222,131,24,139,173,2,152,43,195,67,205,108,96,88,252,75,20,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
