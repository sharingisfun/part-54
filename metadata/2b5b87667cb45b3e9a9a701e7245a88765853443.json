Sometimes satirical, often biting; songs about a regular man&amp;#039;s fight with reality, often amusing frustrations, and obsessive fear of clowns.\n\nConcussive Thought is hard groove driven music. With elements of metal, alternative, and a little jazz. Fidget is heavily influenced by \nDavid Bowie, Rush, Metallica, The Cure, and frightening pictures of clowns... Seriously; clowns are REALLY scary... really...\n\nWe hope you like it!\n\n(This is a legal download, I am the copyright owner, I am releasing this music for free via bittorrent.)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b5b87667cb45b3e9a9a701e7245a88765853443","amp;dn":"Fidget+-+Concussive+Thought","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b5b87667cb45b3e9a9a701e7245a88765853443","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,91,135,102,124,180,91,62,154,154,112,30,114,69,168,135,101,133,52,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
