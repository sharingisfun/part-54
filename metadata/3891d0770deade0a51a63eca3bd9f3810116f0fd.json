There&amp;#039;s a lot you can say with traditional hand gestures and body motions that are universal as well as uniquely Japanese. This whimsical look at &quot;the language of no language&quot; will teach you to hurl insults, flirt, agree, excuse yourself, cross the street, and even make promises-wordlessly! (And who is that stoic guy wearing a suit in all the photos?) Finally, a way to tell someone at a loud party, &quot;Your underwear is showing,&quot; in four easy hand motions. This is a book for the serious student, the class clown, and the crazy guy at Akihabara Station hoping to communicate with Godzilla.\n\n\nReally good book Hope you enjoy it. If you are a japanese Student then I will be uploading alot of books in the future.\n\n\nHere is a link to the book cover :http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51YHkCFbGxL._SS500_.jpg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3891d0770deade0a51a63eca3bd9f3810116f0fd","amp;dn":"70+Japanese+Gestures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3891d0770deade0a51a63eca3bd9f3810116f0fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,145,208,119,13,234,222,10,81,166,62,202,59,217,243,129,1,22,240,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
