These tracks, wich have gone to be re-recorded over the next decade, were repressed in Jamaica for several years and many of the lyrics have been recycled in later songs. These twenty tracks are in many ways the true bedrock of Bob Marley &amp; The Wailers career and are fine examples of just how good a songwriter Bob Marley was a young man in his early twenties.\n(CD liner notes)\n\nMay the lord, the Flying Spaghetti Monster, bless his soul.\n\nTracks\n1- Bend Down Low (Wail'n Soul'm version)\n2- Freedom Time\n3- Stir It Up\n4- This Train\n5- Nice Time (Wail'n Soul'm version)\n6- Hypocrites\n7- Mellow Mood (Wail'n Soul'm version)\n8- Thank You Lord (Wail'n Soul'm version)\n9- Bus Dem Shut\n10- Lyrical Satirical (part 1)\n11- Funeral\n12- Pound Get A Blow\n13- Steppin' Razor\n14- Hurtin' Inside (Wail'n Soul'm version)\n15- Play Play\n16- Them Have Fi Get A Beatin'\n17- Fire Fire\n18- Don't You Rock My Boat\n19- Chances Are (Wail'n Soul'm version)\n20- Lord Will Make Away Somehow\n21- Hypocrites (vocal channel)\n22- Thank Your Lord (vocal channel)\n23- Studio Chat\n\nArtwork (300dpi scan) included.\n\nFormat: FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://flac.sourceforge.net/index.html&lt;/a&gt; \n\nEnjoy, seed and inhale!
