The group combines the punky tunefulness and speedy rhythms of the Descendents with a heavy, prog-influenced sound that owes more to the &quot;math rock&quot; and &quot;screamo&quot; scenes. &quot;Silver Bullet&quot; begins with complex Rush-like start-stop unison fills, before giving way to an ultra-catchy chorus that would make fellow Midwesterners Cheap Trick smile, while &quot;Ohio Is for Lovers&quot; adds a healthy dose of guttural throat-shredding over lyrics that examine love and death. &quot;Niki FM&quot; uses metallic riffing and careening lead guitars to evoke a seemingly obsessive relationship. Equal parts raging post-hardcore and gentle melodicism, THE SILENCE IN BLACK AND WHITE is a dynamic, appealing emo album.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b53b693c50d4e4d5ca9c3ada275b1011c30a432","amp;dn":"Hawthorne_Heights-The_Silence_In_Black_And_White-%28Reissue%29-2005","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b53b693c50d4e4d5ca9c3ada275b1011c30a432","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,83,182,147,197,13,78,77,92,169,195,173,162,117,177,1,28,48,164,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
