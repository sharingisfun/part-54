Also starring in Rocky are Talia Shire as Adrian, Burt Young as Adrian&amp;#039;s brother Paulie, Burgess Meredith as Mickey Goldmill, Rocky&amp;#039;s trainer and Carl Weathers as the champion, Apollo Creed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e94a94f9f7ad5d16f738f376bda5556146fa0c8","amp;dn":"Rocky+I+%281st+Movie%29%21+DVD+RIP%21+sSj","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e94a94f9f7ad5d16f738f376bda5556146fa0c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,148,169,79,159,122,213,209,111,115,143,55,107,218,85,86,20,111,160,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
