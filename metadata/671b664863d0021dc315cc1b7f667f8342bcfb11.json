The band, that was intended to be Williams solo-project from the beginning, was slowly taking form during the next couple of years, and is actually still looking for one last missing member.\nRikard and William recorded a demotape in the rehearsal a few months after the first rehearsal, and kept looking for additional members. First to join was vocalist Emil Englund, and during that year the group had a whole set of different bass players. The band started playing live, and also recorded a second promo, about the same time they got in contact with Relapse records and were set to do a split 7inch with American goregrind heroes EXHUMED. This was the start of the cooperation that later led to the signing of a record deal.\n\nAfter the release of the split, GADGET where still looking for both a drummer and a bass player, but kept writing new material and recorded a set of 7 songs in The Blue Room, later to be used on two compilations released during 2002. First the Polargrinder compilation released by Putrid Filth and Manufactured cR, then the Swedish Assault, released by Relapse Records. The ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œlive-lineupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ was also completed that same year by Fredrik Nygren on bass.[/quote]\n\nRemote\nLabel: Relapse Records \nFormat: CD\nRelease date: Feb 16, 2004\nRipped in 192 :( \nTracks:\n1:: Still\n2:: For what cause?\n3:: Crestfallen \n4:: Death and Destruction\n5:: Unreachable\n6:: The Sentinel\n7:: Wake up the dead\n8:: Fuel\n9:: Rid the darkness\n10:: Failure\n11:: Connected\n12:: Inget val\n13:: Incomplete\n14:: Empty Souls \n15:: Anew\n16:: Tear you apart\n17:: Dethrone\n18:: FÃƒÂ¶rbrukad\n19:: Remote\n20:: Enigmatic\n21:: Tema : Skit\n\nThis album was recorded 15th to 30th of July 2003 at Studio Phlat Planet, Gothemburg.
