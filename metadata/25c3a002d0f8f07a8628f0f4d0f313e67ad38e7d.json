Tarantino\\&amp;#039;s film, \\&amp;#039;Death Proof,\\&amp;#039; is a rip-roaring slasher flick where the killer pursues his victims with a car rather than a knife, while Rodriguez\\&amp;#039;s film \\&amp;#039;Planet Terror\\&amp;#039; shows us a view of the world in the midst of a zombie outbreak. The films are joined together by clever faux trailers that recall the \\&amp;#039;50s exploitation drive-in classics.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25c3a002d0f8f07a8628f0f4d0f313e67ad38e7d","amp;dn":"Grindhouse.Planet.Terror%5B2007%5D.Spanish.Subtitles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25c3a002d0f8f07a8628f0f4d0f313e67ad38e7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,195,160,2,208,248,240,122,134,40,240,244,208,243,19,230,122,211,142,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
