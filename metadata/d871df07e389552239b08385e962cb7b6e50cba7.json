Having brought the latest installment in the series by popular demand, SingleTrac hit a gold mine. It was developed by the game studio SingleTrac, published by Sony, and released in 1996 for Playstation and PC.\n\nThe PC version features slightly cut-down graphics compared to the PlayStation version (minor details of some levels disappeared) but it doesn't require a 3D accelerator video card and plays well on weak computers. It also features multiplayer mode over a modem line or Internet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d871df07e389552239b08385e962cb7b6e50cba7","amp;dn":"Twisted_Metal_II.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d871df07e389552239b08385e962cb7b6e50cba7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,113,223,7,227,137,85,34,57,176,131,133,233,98,203,123,110,80,203,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
