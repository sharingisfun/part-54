They can ring the chords on David Wright&amp;#039;s arrangement of &quot;Waiting for the Robert E. Lee,&quot; as well as blend the lush harmonies of Biebl&amp;#039;s &quot;Ave Maria.&quot; They have lots of fun on &quot;The Pirate Song&quot; and The Music Man&amp;#039;s &quot;Ya&amp;#039; Got Trouble,&quot; veer towards contemporary a cappella on poignant &quot;Bring Him Home,&quot; and close with timely patriotism on &quot;America the Beautiful,&quot; &quot;Armed Forces Medley&quot; and &quot;Star Spangled Banner.&quot; A terrific debut recording!
