A former criminal prosecutor, Clayton takes care of Kenner, Bach, &amp; Ledeen\\&amp;#039;s dirtiest work at the behest of the firm\\&amp;#039;s co-founder, Marty Bach. Though burned out and hardly content with his job as a fixer, his divorce, a failed business venture, and mounting debt have left Clayton inextricably tied to the firm. At U/North, meanwhile, the career of litigator Karen Crowder rests on the multi-million dollar settlement of a class-action suit that Clayton\\&amp;#039;s firm is leading to a seemingly successful conclusion. But when Kenner Bach\\&amp;#039;s brilliant and guilt-ridden attorney Arthur Edens sabotages the U/North case, Clayton faces the biggest challenge of his career and his life. \\&quot; Written by Warner Bros.

So I thought I would share it with you all ;).\n\nAlso look out for:\nRendition\nIn the Valley of Ellah\n\n\nIf there are any suggestions or comments, let me know @ &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;7f121009161a181e13131a0d060f160d1e0b1a3f18121e1613511c1012&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script data-cfhash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;data-cfhash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}t.parentNode.removeChild(t);}}catch(u){}}()/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nThis is my first Torrent I have ever made. So, any feedback would be most appreciated. I used DVD-Cloner Version 5.10, because of the new copy-protection software on DVDs. I was using DVDShrink but, I find that as of late, it cannot crack it. So, again, any feedback would be most appreciated. \n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7dd4480352ee0d03798c8e99241715ab58206b55","amp;dn":"Michael+Clayton+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7dd4480352ee0d03798c8e99241715ab58206b55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,212,72,3,82,238,13,3,121,140,142,153,36,23,21,171,88,32,107,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
