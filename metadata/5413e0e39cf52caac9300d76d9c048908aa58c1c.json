Dark Chest Of Wonders\n  2.  Wish I Had An Angel\n  3.  Nemo\n  4.  Planet Hell\n  5.  Creek Mary&amp;#039;s Blood\n  6.  The Siren\n  7.  Dead Gardens\n  8.  Romanticide\n  9.  Ghost Love Score\n  10. Kuolema Tekee Taiteilijan\n  11. Higher Than Hope\n\nIs there a way to give an album more than five stars!? If so, Once deserves it. Nightwishs previous album Century Child has long been a favorite of mine. Once is a step above that. The album has more of a metal edge to it than Child as well as using the orchestra more. The entire album is a highlight, if youre a Nightwish fan youre sure to appreciate the growth they have undergone between Century Child and now. If you like metal mixed with a symphony you will love Once!! --Allen Chapman\n\nI ripped it from an actual CD, so quality is of the best.  Please seed for as long humanly possible, and all comments are appreciated.  Thank You.
