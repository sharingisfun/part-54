Personally, I think there is always merit in any version of a film that preserves what the makers intended. So, for your consideration, we submit the REAL film, complete with the original ending, which I think is far more appropriate.\nOn behalf of Sam Raimi and Robert Taperi, I'd like to thank all of you fans (you know who you are) for your loyal support of this ridiculous series of films - you are directly responsible for the demand to make this version available.
