These clothes were specifically designed to harmoniously follow her curves and exalt her body shape. Great care was put into the creation of both the mesh and the textures. The mesh is rich in 3d details with natural and un-mirrored folds for a more realistic outcome. The textures were hand-painted over the mesh to enhance the shape and peculiarities of the models. There are various texture options among which you can pic your favourite, all the textures come in 2 versions: with and withouth writings and drawings so that you can also customize them with your own wordings if you want to or use the plain ones.\nAll the pieces can be both used together and separately as you prefer and the numerous texture options give you the possibility to create many variations mixing and matching various colour for the various pieces.
