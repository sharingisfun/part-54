His \nmost recent thriller, Dark Light, was &quot;one of his brightest novels&quot; (South \nFlorida Sun-Sentinel), &quot;a compelling readable tale in the justly celebrated Doc \nFord series by one of this country&amp;#039;s premier crime novelists&quot; (Booklist). With \nHunter&amp;#039;s Moon, White is ready to take another giant leap.\n\nOn a foggy tropic October night, the full moon burning through the mist, I \nstopped paddling when I heard unexpected voices. Muted whispers, neither \nEnglish nor Spanish, the voices of men moving in stealth. They shouldn&amp;#039;t have \nbeen here, I shouldn&amp;#039;t have been here. There were plausible explanations, \nbut I didn&amp;#039;t like any of them.\n\nWhen Ford saves from assassination a controversial former president of the \nUnited States who is staying on an island off Florida&amp;#039;s west coast, he has no \nidea what he&amp;#039;s just let himself in for. Kal Wilson knows that he has only a \nshort time to live, and he has a full agenda. Just months ago, his wife was \nkilled in a plane crash while carrying medical supplies to Nicaragua?a tragic \naccident, everyone agreed. Except Wilson is sure it was no accident. All he \nneeds right now is someone to spring him loose from his security detail, keep \nhim alive for two weeks, and then get him back. And that someone is \nFord...whether he likes it or not.\n\nRich with passion and vivid, pungent prose and some of the best characters \nfound in suspense fiction today, Hunter&amp;#039;s Moon is White&amp;#039;s most remarkable \nnovel yet.\n\n----\n\nRandy Wayne White is the author of thirteen previous Doc Ford \nnovels?Sanibel Flats, The Heat Islands, The Man Who Invented Florida, \nCaptiva, North of Havana, The Mangrove Coast, Ten Thousand Islands, \nShark River, Twelve Mile Limit, Everglades, Tampa Burn, Dead of Night, and \nDark Light?and of the nonfiction collections Batfishing in the Rainforest, The \nSharks of Lake Nicaragua, Last Flight Out, and An American Traveler. He can \nbe found on the internet at www.docford.com.\n\n----\n\nGeorge Guidall is one of the foremost narrators in the audiobook industry, \nhaving recorded more than eight hundred unabridged novels,. His forty-year \ncareer has included leading roles on and off Broadway, and numerous \nappearances in film and on television. He has won an Obie award for best \nperformance.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c9234db776832f50be299799ae170fd39ef1148","amp;dn":"Randy+Wayne+White+-+Hunter%5C%27s+Moon","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c9234db776832f50be299799ae170fd39ef1148","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,146,52,219,119,104,50,245,11,226,153,121,154,225,112,253,57,239,17,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
