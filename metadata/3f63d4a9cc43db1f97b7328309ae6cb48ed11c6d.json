Inpaint may be used to remove undesirable objects from still images. \n\nDelete any unwanted object from your photo, such as extra power-line, people, text... The program will automatically inpaint the selected area to erase it. \n\nIf some unexpected object spoils an otherwise good photograph, Inpaint may be used to remove it. Simply select the object. No need for fiddly messing about with the clone tool! \n\nIt is alarmingly simple to use. Draw a selection around the object you wish to remove from the picture, and run smart remove selection. Inpaint will fill the selection area with intelligently generated texture drawn from the surrounding image data.\n\n\n\nMore infos at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.teorex.com/inpaint.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.teorex.com/inpaint.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis package contains a first Portable version built using RunHiddenConsole.exe to start the Batch file that changes some values in Registry, runs the program and deletes the Registry values when exiting from the program. This is done just to avoid having the sloppy DOS window in the background. Some AVs complain with it recognizing RunHiddenConsole.exe as a malicious/potentially harmful program as it can be used to hide malicious behaviours. If it&amp;#039;s your case, or just don&amp;#039;t trust in the first one, just use the second version.\n\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f63d4a9cc43db1f97b7328309ae6cb48ed11c6d","amp;dn":"InPaint+v1.0+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f63d4a9cc43db1f97b7328309ae6cb48ed11c6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,99,212,169,204,67,219,31,151,183,50,131,9,174,108,180,142,209,28,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
