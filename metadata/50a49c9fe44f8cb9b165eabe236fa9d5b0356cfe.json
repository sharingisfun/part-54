Like all of his other spoken word releases, it is honest and funny. Definitely for fans of the man's work; it will also entertain anyone who likes a little subversive humor (and doesn't mind profanity).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50a49c9fe44f8cb9b165eabe236fa9d5b0356cfe","amp;dn":"Henry+Rollins+-+Eric+the+Pilot+%28spoken+word%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50a49c9fe44f8cb9b165eabe236fa9d5b0356cfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,164,156,159,228,79,140,185,177,101,234,190,35,111,169,213,176,53,108,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
