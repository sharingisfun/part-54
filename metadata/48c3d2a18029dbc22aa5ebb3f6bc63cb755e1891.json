By means of the Belgian DP fanclub, I was already informed about what the sleeve would look like, but once it finally hit the shelves in February 1974, it was still an amazing experience. It was then that rumours had it that the candles that are shown on the album&amp;#039;s cover would be made available to the public. Sadly, thirty years later there still is no sign of those candles. Maybe a small amount were once made available as a promotional gimmick, but thirty years on, for sure most of them, if not all, have completely vanished into thin air! Believe it or not, the company that made the original candles still has the original moulds, and if there&amp;#039;s enough interest (as of this writing) they might supply a limited set of candles for the fans. Each set would contain the five candles as shown on the sleeve.

Especially the soulful voice of Glenn Hughes together with the charismatic appearance of David Coverdale introduced a distinctive new era for Purple. Although the title track most certainly is the kind of rocker authentic Purple diehards love to hear, the album included less hard rocking compositions most fans were expecting. However songs like &quot;You Fool No One&quot; and especially the bluesy &quot;Mistreated&quot; illustrate that there was enormous talent within the band ready to deliver timeless music for years to come. One of my all-time favourites however remains the instrumental &quot;&amp;#039;A&amp;#039; 200&quot; which is a real treat for ARP synth enthusiasts and yet another proof of Jon Lord&amp;#039;s immense talents. Also in &quot;Sail Away&quot; the mighty ARP delivers the low sounding backbone. This revamped Burn edition especially lifts the bass sounds out of the mix much more distinctively than ever before.\nRehearsal tapes from the Burn sessions were located, but sadly the quality was way too poor to include them as bonus material on this remastered edition. Instead a couple of tracks have been remixed, something that would originally have been supervised by Roger Glover but was taken over by Glenn Hughes due to lack of time from Roger. Although I don&amp;#039;t really see the point in remixing what can be seen as authentic rock classics, maybe only &quot;Coronorias Redig&quot; can be seen as interesting and worthwhile. Originally issued as a rare B-side, this instrumental clearly contains ideas that would later surface as Blackmore&amp;#039;s very own &quot;Catch The Rainbow.&quot; You can clearly hear it concerns an authentic jam here, especially towards the improvised ending.\nAs always with Purple re-issues, the liner notes are very detailed and of a very high quality, something the fans will most certainly enjoy. Collectors also note that a double vinyl edition of this remastered 30th anniversary edition will be made available.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48c3d2a18029dbc22aa5ebb3f6bc63cb755e1891","amp;dn":"Deep+Purple+-+Burn+%2830th+Anniver.+Ed.%29+%282004%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48c3d2a18029dbc22aa5ebb3f6bc63cb755e1891","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,195,210,161,128,41,219,194,42,165,235,179,246,188,99,203,117,94,24,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
