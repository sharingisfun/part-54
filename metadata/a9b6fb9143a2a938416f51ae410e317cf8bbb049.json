If there are any aliens, beings from the future, or super-humans, come see me. That is all!&quot;\n\nNaturally, any normal person would think &quot;What the...?&quot; but Haruhi is dead serious. Things get crazy when everyone realizes just how serious she is about it all and establishes the &quot;SOS Dan&quot;.\n\nSuzumiya Haruhi is a good-looking high school girl who has a clear head, naughty personality and very egocentric thought. She has an unimaginably tremendous power to change the world, but she is totally unaware of her own power and so she is also unaware of the effect of her power on the outside world.\n\nA delightfully strange, yet marvelously interesting story!\n\nDual Audio + Eng Subtitles ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9b6fb9143a2a938416f51ae410e317cf8bbb049","amp;dn":"%5BPTKA%5D+The+Melancholy+of+Haruhi+Suzamiya+Dual+Audio+1-4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9b6fb9143a2a938416f51ae410e317cf8bbb049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,182,251,145,67,162,169,56,65,111,81,174,65,14,49,124,248,187,176,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
