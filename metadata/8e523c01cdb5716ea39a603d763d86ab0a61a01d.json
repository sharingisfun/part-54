It is slightly different, as \nAlucard\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s battle with Luke Valentine is extended, a\nnd there are a few scenes of the brothers individually killing \nHellsing soldiers that were not in the manga. \nThe last two chapters of the manga are also left out, \nprobably since the entire episode is heavily action based, \nalthough they are seen as images during the credits. \nOmissions include the introduction of Pip, and Enrico Maxwell with Anderson. \nThe Omake which premieres in volume 2 of the manga is also left out, \nwhich likely means it will not be seen in animated form.\n\nEpisode Three of the OVA follows the events shortly after where the credits of \nHellsing Ultimate II ended. the introduction of the Wild Geese mercenaries, \nIntegra\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s meeting with Enrico Maxwell, Alucard and Walter\\\\\\\\\\\\\\'s discussion about Millennium, \nthe mission to Rio de Janeiro, the massacre at Hotel Rio, \nand the duel between Alucard and Alhambra. In addition the scene with Enrico \ninterrogating the priest from Volume Four was omitted and instead a scene with \nthe Major from Volume Four was added.\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nINFINITY torrents is just repacks to make it easy for you to download complete series and stuff instead of episode by episode.
