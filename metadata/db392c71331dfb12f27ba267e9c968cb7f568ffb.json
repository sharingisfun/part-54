A fantastic late 60s progressive rock album that mixes many styles from folk through to psych and blues fronted by Roger Chapmans unique vocal style. Perhaps a bit more down to earth than their debut but still a masterpiece that deserves your full attention.\n\nenjoy and seed :]\n\n/owl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db392c71331dfb12f27ba267e9c968cb7f568ffb","amp;dn":"Family+-+Family+Entertainment+%281969%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db392c71331dfb12f27ba267e9c968cb7f568ffb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,57,44,113,51,29,251,18,242,123,162,103,233,201,104,203,127,86,143,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
