Encoded with flac version 1.2.1 using highest compression.\nIt was ripped from mint record on the first play.\nGrabbed in 48 kHz 32bit (really it's 24bit (i hope) converted to 32bit), then normalized, then converted to 16bit.\nIf you want to burn these files on CD, you would need to resample them to 44.1 kHz.\nI used 48 kHz for 2 reasons - no downsampling and audio won't be resampled when played on computer - most of the modern audiocards don't support 44.1 kHz output, but i think almost all can play 48 kHz audio.\nCD version of this album is awfully mastered, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loudness_war\nHope you will enjoy this rip, it has no clipping, so sound should be better than from CD version.\nPhotos of box, case, covers and labels are included.\nReleased by parafin.\n\nTracklist:\n01-Never Let Me Down Again (Split Mix).flac\n02-Policy Of Truth (Capitol Mix).flac\n03-Freelove (DJ Muggs Remix).flac\n04-Shout (Rio Mix).flac\n05-Home (Air &quot;Around The Golf&quot; Remix).flac\n06-Strangelove (Blind Mix).flac\n07-Rush (Spiritual Guidance Mix).flac\n08-I Feel You (Afghan Surgery Mix).flac\n09-Barrel Of A Gun (Underworld Hard Mix).flac\n10-Route 66 (Beatmasters Mix).flac\n11-I Feel Loved (Chamber's Remix).flac\n12-Just Can't Get Enough (Schizo Mix).flac\n13-Personal Jesus (Pump Mix).flac\n14-World In My Eyes (Mode To Joy).flac\n15-Painkiller (Kill The Pain Mix - DJ Shadow Vs Depeche Mode).flac\n16-Get The Balance Right (Combination Mix).flac\n17-Everything Counts (Absolut Mix).flac\n18-Breathing In Fumes.flac\n19-Useless (The Kruder + Dorfmeister Session).flac\n20-In Your Room (The Jeep Rock Mix).flac\n21-Dream On (Dave Clarke Acoustic Version).flac\n22-It's No Good (Speedy J Mix).flac\n23-Master And Servant (An ON-USound Science Fiction Dance Hall Classic).flac\n24-Enjoy The Silence (Timo Maas Extended Remix).flac\n25-A Question Of Lust (Flood Mix).flac\n26-Walking In My Shoes (Random Carpet Mix [Full Version]).flac\n27-Are People People?.flac\n28-World In My Eyes (Daniel Miller Remix).flac\n29-I Feel Loved (Danny Tenaglia's Labor Of Love Dub).flac\n30-It's No Good (Club 69 Future Mix).flac\n31-Photographic (Rex The Dog Dubb Mix).flac\n32-Little 15 (Ulrich Schnauss Remix).flac\n33-Nothing (Headcleanr Rock Mix).flac\n34-Lie To Me (The Pleasure Of Her Private Shame).flac\n35-Clean (Colder Version).flac\n36-Halo (Goldfrapp Remix).flac\n37-Enjoy The Silence (Reinterpreted).flac\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4190c5acce71d717361b1e68fb2745aad2746ec8","amp;dn":"Depeche+Mode+-+MUTEL8+-+Remixes+81-04+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4190c5acce71d717361b1e68fb2745aad2746ec8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,144,197,172,206,113,215,23,54,27,30,104,251,39,69,170,210,116,110,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
