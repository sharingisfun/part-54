It later hatches a fully grown, orange creature which kills a background guy and tosses Kowalski around the missile room. Nelson returns and (in a very un-urgent manner) has the crew hunt down this grunting thing as it terrorizes the crew. Later, Crane and Kowalski take the flying sub out to investigate the area, crash landing near the uncharted island. Another orange creature (one that speaks and is the leader) captures them and brings them to creature HQ. The monsters are aliens from Scorpious which are trying to hatch millions of eggs. Can the crew stop this invasion before these amphibian aliens take over the Earth? \n\n\n\n\n\nWriter:  Peter Germano  \n \nDirector:  Jerry Hopper  \n \nStar:  Terry Becker (CPO Francis E.
