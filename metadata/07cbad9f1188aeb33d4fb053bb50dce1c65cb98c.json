In a direct line from the ideas of Flaherty and Vertov, Canadian filmmakers as Michel Brault had made significant shorts as \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Les raquetteurs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; (1959), while in the United States Robert Drew created his seminal work, \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Primary\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; (1960.) All this activity helped the launching of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;cinÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©ma vÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©ritÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; in France, with this film manifesto made by anthropologist Jean Rouch and sociologist Edgar Morin. With a \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;camÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©ra vivant\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot; (living camera) and the question \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Are you happy?\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, they went out to the streets of Paris to make a survey, showing passages in the life of students, workers and migrants (including Joris Ivens\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039; future wife), with a short escapade to the St. Tropez beach, and a final confrontation of the creators and subjects with the footage and the idea of constructing objective pieces of reality on film. Rouch and American Frederick Wiseman believed in a kind of documentary open to emotional spaces and fantasy (as opposed, for example, to Richard Leacock\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s more naturalistic approach), and eventually changed the tone of their works, while the movement finally identified with the concept of \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;direct cinÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©ma\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;, developed by Canadians and American filmmakers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07cbad9f1188aeb33d4fb053bb50dce1c65cb98c","amp;dn":"Chronique+d%5C%27une+Ete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07cbad9f1188aeb33d4fb053bb50dce1c65cb98c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,203,173,159,17,136,174,179,61,79,176,83,187,80,220,225,198,92,185,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
