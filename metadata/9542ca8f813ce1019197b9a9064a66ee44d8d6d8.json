Of course, most of you seem to prefer to see the older shows released anyway, so that isn&amp;#039;t all that surprising.\n\n \n\nThe recording here has got some great performances. At one point, Margo quips to the audience, &quot;I don&amp;#039;t think Mike has played this well all tour.&quot; &quot;Just Want to See&quot; has a great energy to it, and the &quot;Powerfinger&quot; is beautifully solemn.\n\n \n\nI&amp;#039;ve always felt that &quot;Something More Besides You&quot; is one the best songs the band has ever done, proven by how good it sounds both electric and acoustic. It&amp;#039;s actually one of my four favorite Junkies&amp;#039; songs (the others are &quot;Ring on the Sill,&quot; &quot;Witches,&quot; and &quot;Notes Falling Slow.&quot;) Here again, Mike shines, and the &quot;Working on a Building&quot; is a perfect closer to an excellent show.
