All the process of configuration becomes through an assistant in several steps, from which you can create the different accounts of access from your PC, establish the permissions that you want each one and to select the directories and files that you want to share.  As of the moment in which you have the active program, the users with account formed in the same one will be able to enter your PC just by to put your direction IP, and will have access to the functions and the data that you have formed for its accounts.  The input program allows you to control the active processes, to sail by the units of the system, to manage the registry more and, with the possibility of extending its functions by means of plug-ins extra (of which already it brings three built-in ones).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd4cc7a8c01c3d78d1e9a9e16538b606e1841643","amp;dn":"Overseer+v.1.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd4cc7a8c01c3d78d1e9a9e16538b606e1841643","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,76,199,168,192,28,61,120,209,233,169,225,101,56,182,6,225,132,22,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
