Scott was an award-winning, bestselling novelist and a very \ncomplicated man. Early in their relationship, before they married, Lisey had to \nlearn from him about books and blood and bools. Later, she understood that \nthere was a place Scott went?a place that both terrified and healed him, \ncould eat him alive or give him the ideas he needed in order to live. Now it&amp;#039;s \nLisey&amp;#039;s turn to face Scott&amp;#039;s demons. Lisey&amp;#039;s turn to go to Boo&amp;#039;ya Moon. What \nbegins as a widow&amp;#039;s effort to sort through the papers of her celebrated \nhusband becomes a nearly fatal journey into the darkness he inhabited. \nPerhaps King&amp;#039;s most personal and powerful story ever, Lisey&amp;#039;s Story is about \nthe wellsprings of creativity, the temptations of madness, and the secret \nlanguage of love.\n\n----\n\n&quot;In Lisey&amp;#039;s Story, Stephen King makes bold, brilliant use of his satanic \nstorytelling gift, his angelic ear for language, and above all his incomparable \nability to find the epic in the ordinary....&quot;?Michael Chabon\n\n----\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR\n\nStephen King has written more than forty novels and two hundred short \nstories.
