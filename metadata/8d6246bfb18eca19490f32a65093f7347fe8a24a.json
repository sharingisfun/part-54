It\\&amp;#039;s a D20 Campaign Setting written by Michael G. Hurston with cover art by BROM. Description below:\n\nThe world of Ave Molech is a land that has passed through the fires of turmoil and destruction, being tempered and remade into a thriving plane of existence. For the past few hundred years the majority of the worldÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s population has been hiding below ground or floating high above the chaos engulfing the realm. Reestablishing life on the surface is a feat that has only started to take shape over the last two hundred years.\n\nOriginally a realm where the dark lusts and thoughts of man were manifested, nothing could sheath the sword of destruction the people of this world wielded. With kingdoms in constant ruin and the world a struggling war zone, just as many fought for survival as did for power. Little hope existed for any kingdom to take control and make the lands tranquil again, and it wasnÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½t long before the inventions of necessity for war would cause their undoing.\n\nWith an invading force of unstoppable power using advanced weaponry to raze many of the cities, enslaving the people or killing them, many of the worldÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s citizens had little choice but to hide underground or leave to the skies. Whatever culture or history they had was all lost, forgotten and twisted into simple fables over the last few hundred years. Because of this the world split into three distinct realms, each empowering themselves by their own means.\n\nNow, a couple hundred years later, the invading forces have been curtailed and the dimensional doorways for the most part have been shut off; allowing the world to heal and rest from its weary travels. Thanks in part to the comprehension of high powered magic and working with advanced technology the world is quickly reforming and taking shape.\n\nHowever, the greed and selfishness of the people in this world still exists, and for the most part will never diminish completely. Although governments are starting to form and people are working together, the dark desires of mankind are quickly becoming evident. And there is little anyone can do to stop it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d6246bfb18eca19490f32a65093f7347fe8a24a","amp;dn":"Ave+Molech+Second+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d6246bfb18eca19490f32a65093f7347fe8a24a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,98,70,191,177,142,202,25,73,15,50,166,80,147,247,52,127,232,162,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
