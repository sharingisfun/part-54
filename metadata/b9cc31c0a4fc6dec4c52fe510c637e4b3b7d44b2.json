I know they played here a couple of years ago, but unfortunately I found out about it to late.\nThey play an assortment of instruments including, sax, flute, congas, african drums, flugel horn, guitar, organ and many more.\nQuote from the sleeve &amp;quot;Criss-cross rhythms that explode with happiness&amp;quot;\n\nVinyl rip so expect som hiss and pops, slightly cleaned though.\n\nEnjoy the happy vibes and SEED!! :]\n\n/owl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9cc31c0a4fc6dec4c52fe510c637e4b3b7d44b2","amp;dn":"Osibisa+-+Osibisa+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9cc31c0a4fc6dec4c52fe510c637e4b3b7d44b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,204,49,192,164,252,109,236,76,82,254,81,12,99,126,75,59,125,68,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
