The \nprogram includes an interview with a vocal critic about the cautionary tale \nof Mikhail Khordorkovsky, the billionaire entrepreneur who crossed Putin and \nbecame a Siberian prisoner, and a report from our CBC correspondent Alexandra \nSzacka on Putin&amp;#039;s rewriting of the Soviet past, to suit an authoritarian \nfuture. Also, we have an interview with CBC producer Alex Shprintsen who is \npreparing a documentary about the reasons for the popularity of Putin in \nRussia.\n\nOn March 2nd Russians go to the polls to choose a new President to replace \nVladimir Putin after eight years in the job. In the West, observers are \nreluctant to call this an &quot;election&quot;, so suspect is the process. The Kremlin \nhas put forward a candidate, Dimitri Medvedev, who will, undoubtedly become \nthe next President.  His only real competitor, an opponent of Putin&amp;#039;s, named \nMikhail Kazyanov, was banned from the ballot on trumped up charges. Putin \nwill remain powerful. He&amp;#039;s expected to become Prime Minister. The Russian \nmedia, largely muzzled, is cowed by the Kremlin&amp;#039;s power moves. In the West, \nleaders are shocked by this retreat from democracy, but uncertain about how \nto respond.\n\nOne vocal critic, though, is a Canadian lawyer named Robert Amsterdam. He \nhas been tied to Russia ever since he became a lawyer for Mikhail \nKhodorkovsky. He&amp;#039;s the famous Russian tycoon who ended up in a Siberian jail, \nafter crossing Putin in 2003. Back then, Khodorkovsky was Russia&amp;#039;s richest \nman after buying up a huge oil company during the years of  unregulated \nprivatization. At that time, in the early 1990&amp;#039;S, the government sold public \ncompanies for cheap prices to well connected insiders. Many became instant \nmillionaires. Khodorkovsky was among the most influential of the new \ncapitalists...until he publicly criticized Putin and started supporting \nopposition parties. He soon felt Putin&amp;#039;s steel fist.  Arrested for fraud \nand tax evasion he has landed in a prison near Mongolia for a nine year \nterm. This may stretch longer.\n\nRobert Amsterdam continues to represent Khodorkovsky, despite the setbacks. \nMany ordinary Russians are unsympathetic to the tycoon, believing he made \nhis fortune at their expense. But Amsterdam is adament that Khodorkovsky&amp;#039;s \nfate illustrates the brutality of the Putin Regime.\n\nVladimir Putin&amp;#039;s legacy will be having attempted to restore some of the \npower and prestige of Russia, lost when the Soviet Union was dissolved in \nthe 1990&amp;#039;s.\n\nIn that, he was successful, largely because of an oil boom that brought some \nprosperity and renewed influence to an impoverished country. But Putin, a \nproduct of former Communist and KGB networks, has clear ideas about what was \ngood about the past.\n\nUnlike Boris Yeltsin before him, he did not turn his back entirely on the \nSoviet era. Putin is also, it seems, not as critical of Josef Stalin and his \nperiod in power from the 1930&amp;#039;s to the 1950&amp;#039;s, a time of dictatorship and \nrepression, but also one of nation building and a victory at War. The CBC&amp;#039;s \nMoscow correspondent, Alexandra Szacka, explores in a report on our program, \nthe Putin government&amp;#039;s efforts to reappraise the Stalin era..to the horror of \nmany historians and survivors of the Stalinist terror.\n\nFinally, we also have an interview with a journalist here at the CBC who has \ncovered Russia for many years, producer Alex Shprintsen. He&amp;#039;s headed to \nMoscow next week to work on a documentary exploring something the West has \nnever fully understood, the undeniable popularity of Vladimir Putin and of \nmany of his policies.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Post Information\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPosted by............: festering leper\n\nPosted to............: alt.binaries.multimedia\n                       alt.binaries.tv\n                       alt.binaries.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.multimedia.documentaries\n                       alt.binaries.tv.canadian\n\nRepost Policy........: None, sorry!
