BROKEN RAINBOW bears witness to the machinations of energy companies and their government proxies as they eagerly cast aside the peaceful Navajo to make way for oil, gas, uranium and coal exploration. In their own words, elders and outside experts discuss the rich culture and the history of the Navajo as well as their close friends and neighbors the Hopi. The film follows these Native Americans as they take their protest to Congress and join with the militant American Indian Movement, turning their tragedy into acts of heroic resistance. Beautifully photographed and scored, the film captures the sweeping majesty of sacred Native American lands and the people who inhabit them. Narrated by Emmy-winning actor Martin Sheen, BROKEN RAINBOW compassionately illuminates a modern Trail of Tears, giving voice to the conflicts faced by indigenous peoples who struggle to survive in the face of Western imperatives.\n\n(Public law) P.L. 93-531 of 1974 was meant to obliterate the centuries old alliance between the Navajo and Hopi Nations, But all it did was reinforce the bonds among the residents of Big Mountain. \n\nReleased in 1985\nDirected by Victoria Mudd\nNarrated by Martin Sheen\n\nAUDiO.........[ MP3 48000Hz 128 kb/s VBR (2 chnls)\nLANGUAGE......[ English / Navajo\nViDEO.........[ 1280 kbps XviD 23.9 FPS\nRESOLUTiON....[ 512 x 384\nDAR...........[ 1.333\nQUALiTY FRAME.[ 0.273\nSUBS..........[ English (WHEN SPEAKING NAVAJO)\nSiZE..........[ 700 MB\nSOURCE........[ NTSC DVD\nDURATiON......[ 1hr 9mins\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7f0eaec7d5dff4f79f2533d6e0a0e417332d06eb","amp;dn":"Broken.Rainbow.DVDRip.XVID-neocon80.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7f0eaec7d5dff4f79f2533d6e0a0e417332d06eb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,14,174,199,213,223,244,247,159,37,51,214,224,160,228,23,51,45,6,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
