Of course, most of the time, something weird usually happens including aliens planting a chip in Cartman\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s anus and Michael Jackson moves into the neighborhood. Other wild adventures include: the boys blaming their parents for child molestation and Cartman feeding Scott Tenorman his parents in chili. A movie was given in the early seasons in 1999. And the boys enjoy their Terrence &amp; Philip, a Canadian comedy duo (which the parents were against in the movie).\n\nNow on: DVD\nImage\nWidth 320 pixels\nHeight 240 pixels\n\nAudio\nDuration 0:21:45\nBit Rate 24 kbps\nAudio format MPEG Layer-3\n\nVideo\nFrame rate 23 frames/second\nData rate 34 kbps\nVideo sample size 24 bit\nVideo compression Divx codec\n\nAll serii South.Park.S12 sezon - http://ppcmovies.net/index.php?newsid=136","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ede79c534a603e086cbcee77ccd6eb770af44f7","amp;dn":"South.Park.S12E07.%28ppcmovies_net%29_PocketPC.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ede79c534a603e086cbcee77ccd6eb770af44f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,222,121,197,52,166,3,224,134,203,206,231,124,205,110,183,112,175,68,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
