Lyrical and haunting, this album showcases Winter&amp;#039;s soulful and soaring sax within the extraordinary acoustics of the Grand Canyon, among a symphony of wildlife voices.\nContinuing Winter&amp;#039;s legacy of state-of-the-art outdoor recordings, and further refining his musical-ecological vision, CANYON LULLABY is a tender lovesong to one of the most dramatic yet intimate landscapes on Earth.\n\n(Description from Amazon.com)\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b188358b1e0aff0ba1a87e44af9e28f79b18ff01","amp;dn":"Paul+Winter+-+Canyon+Lullaby%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b188358b1e0aff0ba1a87e44af9e28f79b18ff01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,136,53,139,30,10,255,11,161,168,126,68,175,158,40,247,155,24,255,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
