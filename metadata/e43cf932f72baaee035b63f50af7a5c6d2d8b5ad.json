The venue is one of the smallest the band has played in recent years, holding only 250 people. Margo joked at one point that she felt like a giant on the stage.\n\nThis was another in a series of shows the band played in ski towns. The tour was quick. One interesting facet of the tour was the substitute drummer, Randal Coryell. Peter Timmins had hurt his back at the beginning of the year and was sidelined for this tour. Margo joked at each show, &quot;My brother Pete turned 40 this year.&quot; Randal didn&amp;#039;t have much time to rehearse, and did an amazing job filling in. Jeff Bird had played with him before, so there was some pre-existing chemistry.\n\nThis intimate performance featured some amusing moments, as well as excellent playing. the band got down to business early, opening with &quot;Blue Moon Revisited (A Song for Elvis)&quot; and transitioning into an angry sounding &quot;Just Want to See.&quot; A long &quot;Lay It Down&quot; led into the mini-acoustic set. On the encore Mike and Margo answered a fan&amp;#039;s request and played &quot;Sun Comes Up, It&amp;#039;s Tuesday Morning,&quot; and Margo flubbed the words at first before starting again and finishing perfectly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e43cf932f72baaee035b63f50af7a5c6d2d8b5ad","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies+2006-02-26+%40+Sheridan+Opera+House+-+Telluride%2C+CO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e43cf932f72baaee035b63f50af7a5c6d2d8b5ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,60,249,50,247,43,170,238,3,91,99,245,10,247,165,198,210,216,181,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
