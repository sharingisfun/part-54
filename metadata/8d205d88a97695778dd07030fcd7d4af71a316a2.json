Flash forward to the present day, where Kafka aficionado Sydney Cunliffe is writing an article on the great man, and events begin to take a distincly Kafkaesque turn. First a mysterious stranger appears on Sydney&amp;#039;s doorstep, claiming to be Max Brod (who has been dead since 1968). Then Cunliffes&amp;#039; tortoise metamorphoses into Kafka himself.\n\nMax is desperate to prevent his old friend from discovering that he didn&amp;#039;t burn all his books, for it soon becomes clear that all Kafka ever wanted was anonymity, and to get his own back on his bullying father. But when Kafka Senior turns up, he insists that his son buries the hatchet. If not, he will reveal Kafka&amp;#039;s secret - the real truth about him ad his &amp;#039;old man&amp;#039;...\n\nSet in Prague, 27 Batcliffe Drive and Heaven, Bennett&amp;#039;s brilliantly clever, fast-moving comedy not only examines the relationship between life and art, but also asks a rather more fundamental question: what exactly was Kafka&amp;#039;s embarrassing little problem?&quot;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d205d88a97695778dd07030fcd7d4af71a316a2","amp;dn":"Alan+Bennett+-+Kafka%5C%27s+Dick+-+A+BBC+4+Full-Cast+Drama","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d205d88a97695778dd07030fcd7d4af71a316a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,32,93,136,169,118,149,119,141,208,112,48,252,215,212,175,113,163,22,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
