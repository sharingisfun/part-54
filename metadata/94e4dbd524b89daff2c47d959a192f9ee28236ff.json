Martel\t... \tGreg\n\nElliot is your normal boy, until one day, when he meets a little lost alien. Elliot decides to keep the alien, in which he gives the name E.T. Elliot works with E.T. in trying to find him a way to get back home. Elliot must make the difficult sacrifice. Whether to help his new friend or to lose him? Whatever the decision is, Elliot must keep him hidden, as someone else is out to look for him.\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n___________________________________\nTrivia:Harrison Ford played the school principal, but his only scene was cut as Steven Spielberg considered his presence would be too distracting. Ford&amp;#039;s wife Melissa Mathison wrote the screenplay.\n\nET&amp;#039;s face was modeled after poet Carl Sandburg, Albert Einstein and a pug dog.\n\nET&amp;#039;s communicator actually worked, and was constructed by Henry Feinberg, an expert in science and technology interpretation for the public.\n\nSteven Spielberg shot most of the film from the eye-level of a child to further connect with Elliot and E.T.\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n______________________________________\n\nVideo info: MPEG2 720x480 NTSC 16:9 letbox  PGC 1.
