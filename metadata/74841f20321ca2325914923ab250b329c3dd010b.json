She first recorded the song in 1979 with two of the Sex Pistols: Steve Jones and Paul Cook. This first version was not a hit. In 1982, Jett re-recorded the song, this time with her band, the Blackhearts, and this recording became a U.S. Billboard Hot 100 number-one single for seven weeks, effectively launching Jett&amp;#039;s solo career and later reached number one in the Australian charts as well. Its success propelled Jett&amp;#039;s I Love Rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; Roll album to number two in the U.S.\n\n&quot;I Love Rock &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; Roll&quot;&amp;#039;s gritty, black-and-white music video received heavy play from the then-young MTV network. In it Jett and the Blackhearts travel to a small, dingy bar and proceed to excite the drunken crowd by performing the song and yelling out its famous chorus. \n\nIn March 2005, Q magazine placed Jett&amp;#039;s version of the song at number 85 in its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks.\n\nJett&amp;#039;s version is also ranked #484 on the Rolling Stone magazine&amp;#039;s list of &quot;the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74841f20321ca2325914923ab250b329c3dd010b","amp;dn":"Joan+Jett+%26+The+Blackhearts+-+I+Love+Rock+%5C%27N%5C%27+Roll","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74841f20321ca2325914923ab250b329c3dd010b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,132,31,32,50,28,162,50,89,20,146,58,178,80,179,41,195,221,1,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
