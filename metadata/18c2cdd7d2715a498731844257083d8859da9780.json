A radioactive remote zaps Bart &amp;amp; Lisa into Itchy &amp;amp; Scratchy's cartoon\n    universe, where the stakes are not only life and death, they're sharp and pointy! In The Terror\n    of Tiny Town! Jerry Springer presides, as Kang, a drooling alien from Rigel 7, dukes it out with\n    Homer over Maggie's paternity in Starship Poopers.\n\n    The Cartridge Family : He who shoots first laughs best! Fearing for the safety of his family in\n    the face of a soccer-inspired city-wide orgy of destruction, Homer buys a handgun. Fearing for\n    the safety in the face of Homer's trigger-happy gun-crazed ways, the family flees. A merrily\n    deranged and instructive tale of deadly force, common sense divorces and buyer's remorse.\n\n    Natural Born Kissers : Rock the Casbah! While trying to jump-start the old marriage, Homer and\n    Marge discover the exhilarating private rush of almost-public snuggling. No part of Springfield\n    is off-limits in this hilariously shameful saga of prickly hay lofts, erotic holes of miniature\n    golf, clothing-optional hot-air balloons, and spectator-filled stadiums!\n\n    Grampa vs Sexual Inadequacy : This'll put the wowzers back in your trousers! The magnificent\n    medicinal miracle of Grampa's Revitalizing Tonic saves Homer's marriage - but at what cost?!\n    Thrill to the vibrating sarcophagus of the Pharaoh's Chamber! Witness the vengeful love between\n    father and son! Drink a cheap substitute for holy water!\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nJa vad sÃƒÂ¤ger man?
