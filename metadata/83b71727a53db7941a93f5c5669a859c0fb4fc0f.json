An apparent investigation into the fringes of psychic spirituality with so-called real experts, exorcisms and seances, be warned Journey also manages to be a very sleazy cocktail indeed. There\\&amp;#039;s many a grotty scene of real brain tumor removal and animal cruelty. An unforgettable scene offers a Third-World doctor yanking out cancers from his patients using his bare hands and no anaesthetic. Although it seems less outrageous compared to later films of its ilk i.e. the Faces of Death series, Journey turned many people pale in the Seventies. Some prints came with a warning bell to alert viewers of the more vomitous scenes and when it was shown at a Spanish horror film festival in 1978 it had mass walkouts and numerous retchings.\\&quot;\n\nThis was in the \\&quot;Faces of Death\\&quot; section of the video store I work at. I don\\&amp;#039;t really know what else to say about this.\n\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/reverendbeastly/cinemageddon/journey1.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/reverendbeastly/cinemageddon/journey2.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/reverendbeastly/cinemageddon/journey3.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/reverendbeastly/cinemageddon/journey4.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v92/reverendbeastly/cinemageddon/journey5.png[/IMG]\n\nTrailer:\n\nGSpot:\nfilename:       Journey.Into.The.Beyond.1977.VHSRIP.XViD-CG.avi\nfilesize:       889,251,840\nvideo codec:    XviD ISO MPEG-4\nvideo bitrate:  958kbps\nduration:       1:44:20\nresolution:     544*416\nfps:            29.970\naudio codec:    0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\naudio bitrate:  164kbps VBR\naudio channels: 2\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83b71727a53db7941a93f5c5669a859c0fb4fc0f","amp;dn":"Journey+into+the+Beyond+%5B1977%2FVHSRIP%2FXViD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83b71727a53db7941a93f5c5669a859c0fb4fc0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,183,23,39,165,61,183,148,26,147,245,197,102,154,133,156,15,180,252,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
