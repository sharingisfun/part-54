Although their music sounds noticeably different from any sort of traditional punk, it contains some punk elements: shrieking vocals, overdriven guitars, and one-and-a-half minute songs. Melt Banana's unique style, however, comes as a result of the distinctly piercing vocals of lead singer Yasuko O., as well as the frenzied, effect-charged playing of guitarist Agata. Searing, intense, and mind-blowingly fast are perhaps the first adjectives that come to mind when listening to Melt Banana's music.\n\nWith the latest album, their undeniably unique sound is now more relevant than ever, perhaps even more so, resulting in an increasingly infectious sonic assault that will please longtime fans and peak curiosity in the uninitiated.\n\nTrack list\n------------\n\n01 Phantasmagoria \t\n02 Shield for Your Eyes, A Beast in the Well on Your Hand \t\t\n03 A Dreamer Who Is Too Weak to Face Up To \t \t\n04 Lost Parts Stinging Me So Cold \t \t\n05 Chain-Shot to Have Some Fun \t \t\n06 Like a White Bat in a Box, Dead Matters Go On \t \t\n07 Key Is a Fact That a Cat Brings \t \t\n08 A Hunter in the Rain to Cut the Neck Up in the Present Stage \t \t\n09 If It Is the Deep Sea, I Can See You There \t \t\n10 Outro for Cell-Scape\n\n@192 kb/s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57197a9dab762a1338fd074daeb9d883370c4df8","amp;dn":"Melt+Banana+-+Cell+Scape-2003-pH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57197a9dab762a1338fd074daeb9d883370c4df8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,25,122,157,171,118,42,19,56,253,7,77,174,185,216,131,55,12,77,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
