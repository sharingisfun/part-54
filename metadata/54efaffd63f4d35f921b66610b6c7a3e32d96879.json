His character is really a pathetic example of a life wasted. His still lives in a second class ordinary apartment with his junkie son and a female companion.\n\nEnter an undercover FBI agent played sternly and completely in control at all times by Johnny Depp. His assignment is to get inside the life of Pacino and the organization he associates with and break it up. It&amp;#039;s a job he performed for almost three years from 1978 to 1981 and his work along with other agents led to over two hundred indictments and one hundred convictions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54efaffd63f4d35f921b66610b6c7a3e32d96879","amp;dn":"Donnie+Brasco+%28Full+Movie%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54efaffd63f4d35f921b66610b6c7a3e32d96879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,239,175,253,99,244,211,95,146,27,102,97,11,108,122,62,50,217,104,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
