Trumpeter Donald Byrd and a septet that also includes tenor saxophonist Hank Mobley, guitarist Kenny Burrell, and pianist Herbie Hancock are joined by an eight-voice choir directed by Coleridge Perkinson. The arrangements by Duke Pearson are masterful and one song, &amp;quot;Cristo Redentor,&amp;quot; became a bit of a hit. This is a memorable effort that is innovative in its own way, a milestone in Donald Byrd's career. - from AMG.\n\nVery good album from Mr. Byrd.\n\nenjoy and seed :]\n\n/owl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8783274b00d3ae66daa7a99d90e35edcc2441673","amp;dn":"Donald+Byrd+-+A+New+Perspective+%28BlueNote-1963%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8783274b00d3ae66daa7a99d90e35edcc2441673","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,131,39,75,0,211,174,102,218,167,169,157,144,227,94,220,194,68,22,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
