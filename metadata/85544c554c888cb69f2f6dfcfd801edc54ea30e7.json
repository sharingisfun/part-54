Or would the climate teeter between cataclysmic extremes? Today, the moon shines brightly in the night sky from about a quarter of a million miles away. When it first formed though, it was 15 times closer to Earth and its gravity had a tremendous influence on the planet. Slowly drifting further away from Earth, the moon has reshaped the world. It created seasons, the 24-hour day, tides and may have even influenced the evolution of life here on Earth.\n\n\n\nRelated Documentaries\n\n* Birth of the Earth\n* The Moon\n* Moon for Sale\n\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate: 2022 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nVideo Resolution: 688 x 384\nAudio Codec: MPEG-1 Layer 3 (MP3)\nAudio BitRate: 160 KB/s (CBR)\nAudio Channels: 2 Ch\nRunTime: 00:47\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 744 MB\nEncoded by: gavin63\nSubtitles: No TV Cap\nSource: DVB\nwww mvgroup org avi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85544c554c888cb69f2f6dfcfd801edc54ea30e7","amp;dn":"National+Geographic+Naked+Science+Moon+Mysteries+DVB+Xvid+mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85544c554c888cb69f2f6dfcfd801edc54ea30e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,84,76,85,76,136,140,182,159,47,109,252,253,128,30,220,84,234,48,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
