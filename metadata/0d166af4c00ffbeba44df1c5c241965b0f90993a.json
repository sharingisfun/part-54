Length : 139min                    \n\n\n Peter Parker has finally managed to piece together the once-broken parts of  \n his life, maintaining a balance between his relationship with Mary-Jane and  \n his responsibility as Spider-Man. But more challenges arise for our young    \n hero. Peter&amp;#039;s old friend Harry Obsourne has set out for revenge against      \n Peter; taking up the mantle of his late father&amp;#039;s persona as The New Goblin,  \n and Peter must also capture Uncle Ben&amp;#039;s real killer, Flint Marko, who has    \n been transformed into his toughest foe yet, the Sandman. All hope seems      \n lost when suddenly Peter&amp;#039;s suit turns jet-black and greatly amplifies his    \n powers. But it also begins to greatly amplify the much darker qualities of   \n Peter&amp;#039;s personality that he begins to lose himself to. Peter has to reach    \n deep inside himself to free the compassionate hero he used to be if he is    \n to ever conquer the darkness within and face not only his greatest enemies,  \n but also...himself.                                                          \n                                                                              \n\n--------==========----------\nHappy Hacker Industries \n\nIs an Audio/Video ripping group founded several years ago\nby a few individuals who do nothing but deal with computers\non a yearly 24/7 schedule; and sometimes when sleeping. \n\nWe release things as we find the time to do so, we do not \nrelease items necessarily as they come out in the stores.\nWe take pride in our releases and do monitor various outlets\nwhere our work can be acquired.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d166af4c00ffbeba44df1c5c241965b0f90993a","amp;dn":"SpiderMan+3.WS.2007.XviD.HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d166af4c00ffbeba44df1c5c241965b0f90993a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,22,106,244,192,15,251,235,164,77,241,197,194,65,150,91,15,144,153,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
