Now you can forget about\n   stages, missions, and passing the game on a piece of paper. Events in the\n   game occur Ã¢â‚¬Å“for realÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and are not just triggered by a date, or other event,\n   following a fixed script. \n\n   It is a coherent and live world in which each character really exists.\n   Even leaving playersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ field of vision, other ships and planets continue\n   their own adventures, living their own lives as long as the game lasts.\n\n   You have the chance become one of the adventuring Rangers, and it is\n   possible that it is you who will, in the end, save the Galaxy. Every\n   living thing in the world is in grave danger!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0bebe7dc0ec494b752aef59359524529cfc14ed","amp;dn":"Space.Rangers-RELOADED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0bebe7dc0ec494b752aef59359524529cfc14ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,190,190,125,192,236,73,75,117,42,239,89,53,149,36,82,156,252,20,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
