The tracks included are uncut, and even include the national advertising spots that were to air at that time. I actually ran these discs in the studio, aired them myself, and found the show quite enjoyable. When I left the station, I asked if I may have the discs for myself, which they obliged. Hopefully you will find them enjoyable too. \n\nThis posthumous production featuring Stevie Ray Vaughan includes interviews from Tommy Shannon, Chris Layton, Buddy Guy, and others. A nice addition to any SRV fan\\\\\\&amp;#039;s collection. I\\\\\\&amp;#039;ve searched, and I would assume this is the only copy of this floating around.\n\nrecorded in 192kbps total running time about 123 minutes 12 files total.\n\nBe gentle, it\\\\\\&amp;#039;s my first torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd2f1036b636ccd5059caba9d57962b17aab289a","amp;dn":"Album+Network+Broadcast+-+In+The+Studio+-+Stevie+Ray+Vaughan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd2f1036b636ccd5059caba9d57962b17aab289a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,47,16,54,182,54,204,213,5,156,171,169,213,121,98,177,122,171,40,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
