The word \n\n&quot;Ajahn&quot; is not a proper name, but a title which means &quot;Teacher&quot; in \n\nThai. He is also affectionately known among his students as &quot;Venerable \n\nFather&quot; in Thai. He has been an ordained bhikkhu for 40 years, and is \n\nperhaps the most senior living Western Theravadin bhikkhu.\n\nAjahn Sumedho is a prominent figure in the Thai Forest Tradition. His \n\nteachings are very direct, practical, simple, and down to earth. In \n\nhis talks and sermons he stresses the quality of immediate intuitive \n\nawareness and the integration of this kind of awareness into daily \n\nlife. Like most teachers in the Forest Tradition, Ajahn Sumedho tends \n\nto avoid intellectual abstractions of the Buddhist teachings and \n\nfocuses almost exclusively on their practical applications, that is, \n\ndeveloping wisdom and compassion in daily life. His most consistent \n\nadvice can be paraphrased as to see things the way that they actually \n\nare rather than the way that we want or don&amp;#039;t want them to be (&quot;Right \n\nnow, it&amp;#039;s like this...&quot;). He is known for his engaging and witty \n\ncommunication style, in which he challenges his listeners to practice \n\nand see for themselves. Students have noted that he engages his \n\nhearers with an infectious sense of humor, suffused with much loving \n\nkindness, often weaving amusing anecdotes from his experiences as a \n\nmonk into his talks on meditation practice and how to experience life \n\n(&quot;Everything belongs&quot;).\n\n\nList of Tracks in this torrent:\n\nAjahn Sumedho_Limitations Of Thought_ - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_Listening To The Sound Of Silence_ - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_Mindfulness_ - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_Mother Earth, Father Sky, And The Middle Way_ - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_Relaxed Attention_06 - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_Relaxed Receptivity_ - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_Right View_09 - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_Space And Consciousness_ - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_Suffering Should Be Welcomed - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_Swimming Around In The Sea Of Consciousness_ - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_Terrorist In The Bushes_ - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_Terrorist In The Bushes_01 - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_That Which Is Inclusive_ - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_The End Of Suffering Is Now_ - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_The Goody Good Practice_08 - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_The Lion&amp;#039;s Roar Of Mara_ - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_The Path To Liberation_ - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_Unconditioned Love_ - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_We Are The Best_07 - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_Welcoming Receptivity_ - .mp3\nAjahn Sumedho_What Is The Unconditioned__03 - .mp3\nlistoffiles.txt\n              22 File(s)    287,094,784 bytes\n\nThis is part two of two parts.  \n\nAccumulate Merit - Keep Sharing!\n\nI am here.\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://suprbay.org/member.php?u=39663&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://suprbay.org/member.php?u=39663&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor more Dharma check out:\n     &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/karmapa&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thepiratebay.se/user/karmapa&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFor more Theravada Buddhism visit Wat Washington Buddhavanaram\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.watwashington.org&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.watwashington.org&lt;/a&gt;\n\nKarmapa Chenno!\t\t\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6f7b43f6c35966439ca134e34675ae86be28c10","amp;dn":"Buddhist+Dharma+Ajahn+Sumedho+Theravada+Bhikkhu+Part+2+of+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6f7b43f6c35966439ca134e34675ae86be28c10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,247,180,63,108,53,150,100,57,202,19,78,52,103,90,232,107,226,140,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
