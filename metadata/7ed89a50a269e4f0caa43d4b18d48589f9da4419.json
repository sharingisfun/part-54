The comic had previously been adapted for the screen back in 1988 as an anime, and while it covered the complex material well, it now looks rather dated. This new version is a huge leap forward in technical and visual terms, far exceeding the previous benchmark for computer animation, the dull and generic &quot;Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within&quot;. Thankfully, just as much attention has been paid to retaining the unique feel of the manga and in translating its multi-layered narrative and themes into a coherent, streamlined film.\n\n*This is the iNT rip of Appleseed 2004 and the latest English Subs from &lt;URL&gt;www.kloofy.net&lt;/URL&gt;\n\n&lt;CENTER&gt;\n\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://img160.exs.cx/img160/7936/assizes0026rl.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image Hosted by \nImageShack.us&quot; /&gt;\n\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://img160.exs.cx/img160/5743/aseedcpbg05x4thc1jt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image Hosted by \nImageShack.us&quot; /&gt;\n\n&lt;img src=&quot;http://img160.exs.cx/img160/3853/aseedcpbg04x43vw.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Image Hosted by \nImageShack.us&quot; /&gt;\n\n&lt;/CENTER?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ed89a50a269e4f0caa43d4b18d48589f9da4419","amp;dn":"%5BiNT%5D+Appleseed+%282004%29+%28English+Soft-Subs%29+%282-CD%29+%5BDivX+5+2+0+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ed89a50a269e4f0caa43d4b18d48589f9da4419","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,216,154,80,162,105,228,240,202,164,61,75,24,212,133,137,249,218,68,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
