After all, half of Lies was released in 1986 (as the EP Live Like a Suicide), and one of its four new studio tracks is simply an acoustic version of &quot;You&amp;#039;re Crazy,&quot; from Appetite for Destruction. The arithmetic is simple: hungry fans plus any new product plus hordes of holiday shoppers equals one profitable little stocking stuffer.\nThe good news is that Lies is a lot more interesting than that. Serious fans ? even those who might have missed the previously released tracks ? will want to concern themselves with the new side of the album first. The calm folk-rock melodies of these four acoustic songs reveal yet another welcome facet of Guns n&amp;#039; Roses. They should also end any further mutterings from the doubting Thomases out there who are still making snide comments about the band&amp;#039;s potential for longevity.\nThe lyrics are typically controversial. There&amp;#039;s &quot;Used to Love Her&quot; (&quot;But I had to kill her&quot;), a hilarious countryish number that will probably have feminist hot lines jammed across the country, and &quot;One in a Million,&quot; a beautiful ballad that attacks nearly every minority group in existence; its lyrics are patented Axl Rose venom tempered with something that sounds oddly like compassion. &quot;Patience,&quot; a song familiar to fans who&amp;#039;ve seen the band live, and &quot;You&amp;#039;re Crazy,&quot; in its original laid-back form, serve as added bonuses.\nIf you were expecting another Appetite for Destruction, this record ? or at least its acoustic half ? may disappoint you. But if you&amp;#039;ve been looking for proof that Guns n&amp;#039; Roses aren&amp;#039;t just another thrash in the pan, G n&amp;#039; R Lies is what you&amp;#039;ve been waiting for. And much more.
