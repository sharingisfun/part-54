For example, \nif you upgrade your PC, or your PC's hard disk, \nwhat about all the files on it \n(including your personal financial records? \n&lt;P&gt;\nDonate it to charity and who knows who will end up reading \nabout your offshore bank accounts? &quot;Sanitizing&quot; \n(as those Pentagon generals say) \nyour hard disk before throwing it out or giving a \nit away is certainly advisable. \n&lt;P&gt;\nAs another example, suppose during your lunch hour at work you're \nsurfing the web and you (accidentally, of course) \nstumble upon some porno site. \nBy the time you realize what has happened, \nand click the Back button, \nyour browser has already saved maybe several \nGIFs of naked women \n(or worse, naked men, boys or prepubescent girls) \nto your hard disk. \n&lt;P&gt;\nOops! Maybe no-one will ever find them. \nBut to be sure you could run Data Destroyer on all \nthe images in your browser's \ncache folder, before deleting them. That way you can be sure \nno-one will accuse you of pedophilia, \nbestiality or some other disreputable predilection.\n&lt;P&gt;\nOf course, there are lots of other cases where you might want to \nensure that no-one will ever be able to read your deleted files.\n&lt;P&gt;\nData Destroyer will purge either: \n  - A single file. \n  - All files in a folder. \n  - A specified subset of files in a folder. \n  - All files in a folder and all files in all subfolders of that folder. \n  - A specified subset of all files in a folder and in all \nsubfolders of that folder. \n  - All space on a disk. \n  - All unused clusters on a disk.\n&lt;P&gt;\nThis software checks for possible errors in user input, \nand is designed to minimize the chance of accidentally \npurging a file that you wish to keep. \n&lt;P&gt;\nIt is even possible, in a multiple-file purge operation, \nto confirm the operation \non each file before it is purged.\n&lt;P&gt;\nAnother feature of Data Destroyer is that you can get an \naccurate estimate of the time required to perform a purge operation. \nA lengthy purge operation may require several hours, or even days, \nand if you did not have an accurate estimate \nof the time needed before beginning the operation you \nmight get worried, not \nknowing how long it still has to run.\n&lt;P&gt;\nData Destroyer erases data from any writable magnetic \nstorage medium. \n&lt;P&gt;\nIt is not suitable for erasing data on CD-ROMs or other optical \nstorage media.\n&lt;P&gt;\nfriends: &lt;a href=&quot;http://btgm.cjb.net&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Pink&quot;&gt;btgm.cjb.net&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;/HTML&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd6daca671c702b921bc3b2c3f2e0133d31ce2b1","amp;dn":"Data.Destroyer.v6.34-UCF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd6daca671c702b921bc3b2c3f2e0133d31ce2b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,109,172,166,113,199,2,185,33,188,59,44,63,46,1,51,211,28,226,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
