Director and Producer is Henry Hathaway. \nThe DVD is originally a Region 1 DVD and in NTSC format and has english subtitles. \nThe DVD is ripped with DVD Decrypter. The original DVD is 7.40 GB and reduced to 4.35 Gb with DVDShrink. It is testburned by Nero 6 on Fortis DVD-R and played on Panasonic SA-HT70. \nSpecial features are included. \n\nMake your self a cup of coffee, pour yourself a glass of single malt (I suggest Bowmore, 15 years) and add some pieces of bitter chocolate (72% cocoa). The film is straight forward, no questions asked Ã¢â‚¬â€œ no answers given. Just relax and enjoy it (and the beverage). \nOh, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m sorry Ã¢â‚¬â€œ one question arose during the watching Ã¢â‚¬â€œ what is Fabian doing - and why? \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0144cefb1189d2a53f2d38e10b5cc7b0a422ae74","amp;dn":"John+Wayne%2FStewart+Granger+-+North+to+Alaska","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0144cefb1189d2a53f2d38e10b5cc7b0a422ae74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,68,206,251,17,137,210,165,63,45,56,225,11,92,199,176,164,34,174,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
