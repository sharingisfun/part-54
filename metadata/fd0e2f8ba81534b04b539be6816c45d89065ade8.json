If your AV is one of them, or if you don&amp;#039;t trust too much to it, use the second one that runs directly the batch file. You will have the sloppy DOS window in the background but less complaints from antiviruses...\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd0e2f8ba81534b04b539be6816c45d89065ade8","amp;dn":"RegDoctor+1.97+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd0e2f8ba81534b04b539be6816c45d89065ade8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,14,47,139,168,21,52,176,75,83,155,230,129,108,69,216,144,101,173,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
