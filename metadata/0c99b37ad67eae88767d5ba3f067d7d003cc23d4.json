The dynamic duo of Joe Thornton and Jonathan Chechoo were the main dangermen, but it was the Sharks&amp;#039; defence that prevailed early on.\n\nMany doubted the Oilers&amp;#039; chances after digging themselves a hole, but watch in awe as The Pride of Alberta roars back and drown the Sharks in oil. Oh yeah, also helped by THAT save from Albert Roloson.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c99b37ad67eae88767d5ba3f067d7d003cc23d4","amp;dn":"The+Edmonton+Oilers+Cup+Run+of+2006+-+Western+SF+vs+The+Sharks","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c99b37ad67eae88767d5ba3f067d7d003cc23d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,153,179,122,214,126,174,136,118,125,91,163,240,103,215,208,3,204,35,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
