Maya wants to know absolutely everything about how her \nparents met and fell in love. Will&amp;#039;s story begins in 1992, as a young, \nstarry-eyed aspiring politician who moves to New York from Wisconsin in order to \nwork on the Clinton campaign. For Maya, Will relives his past as a idealistic \nyoung man learning the ins and outs of big city politics, and recounts the \nhistory of his romantic relationships with three very different women. On the \ncampaign, Will&amp;#039;s best buddy is Russell McCormack. They not only have similar \npolitical aspirations, they share the same type of girl problems, too. Will \nhopelessly attempts a &quot;PG&quot; version of his story for his daughter ad changes the \nnames so Maya has to guess who he finally married. Is her mother Will&amp;#039;s college \nsweetheart, the dependable girl next-door Emily? Is she his longtime best friend \nand confidante, he apolitical April? Or is she the free-spirited but ambitious \njournalist? As Maya puts together the pieces of her dad&amp;#039;s romantic puzzle, she \nbegins to understand that love is not so simple or easy. And as Will tells her \nhis tale, Maya helps him to understand that it&amp;#039;s definitely never too late to go \nback...and maybe even possible to find a happy ending.\n\nDirector: Adam Brooks\n\nWriter  : Adam Brooks\n\nCast:\n\nRyan Reynolds ...
