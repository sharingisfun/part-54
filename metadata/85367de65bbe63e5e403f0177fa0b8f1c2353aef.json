Collins Show is for all Americans. It&amp;#039;s a lively forum with views and voices not often heard in the traditional media.\n\nPeter B. Collins, the veteran San Francisco talk show host, invites calls from listeners of all viewpoints. Most talk show callers today are screened to ensure that they agree with the host. We welcome people with different opinions, and we don&amp;#039;t require political correctness. We connect politically interested people by bringing their uninhibited exchanges to the public airwaves.\n\nAlso try listening to Thom Hartmann,  Randi Rhodes,  Ed Schultz and Mike Malloy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85367de65bbe63e5e403f0177fa0b8f1c2353aef","amp;dn":"Peter+B+Collins+Show+-+June+24%2C+2008+%2824kbs+Audio%29.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85367de65bbe63e5e403f0177fa0b8f1c2353aef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,54,125,230,91,190,99,229,228,3,240,23,127,160,184,241,194,53,58,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
