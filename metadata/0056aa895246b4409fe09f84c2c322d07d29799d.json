Four CD&amp;#039;s, the first of two box sets for the Today album.  Is this overkill or what?  Somebody pinch me.  A whole disc devoted to &quot;When I Grow Up To Be A Man&quot; sessions (with a very tired, and uptight group trying to lay down the track at 11:00 pm), including outtakes of &quot;I&amp;#039;m Dumb&quot; (a fabulous &quot;lost&quot; song of Brian&amp;#039;s, given away to Glen Campbell), large chunks of outtakes for &quot;Dance, Dance, Dance,&quot; (including tense, argumentative vocal sessions) &quot;She Knows Me Too Well,&quot; &quot; Don&amp;#039;t Hurt My Little Sister,&quot; &quot;All Dressed Up For School,&quot; and the heavenly &quot;Kiss Me Baby.&quot;  Have I mentioned that these tracks are almost ALL in true stereo?    Whoops!  I&amp;#039;m drooling all over my keyboard... but again, a reminder that these are, for the most part, studio outtakes, and your enjoyment of them depends entirely on whether you like listening to rough, unfinished, works-in-progress.  In particular, you can hear how Brian constructed the recordings, layering the basic tracks with vocal and instrumental overdubs with astonishing skill and foresight.  This set is simply being able to hear Brian Wilson in his prime, constructing timeless, heartfelt music.  Unmissable.\n\nCD Features Include:\n\n7 takes of &quot;She Knows Me Too Well&quot; \n11 takes of &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Hurt My Little Sister&quot; \n14 takes of &quot;When I Grow Up To Be A Man&quot; \n6 takes of &quot;I&amp;#039;m So Young&quot; \n6 takes of &quot;Guess I&amp;#039;m Dumb&quot; \n7 takes of &quot;All Dressed UP For School&quot; \n17 takes of &quot;Dance Dance Dance&quot; \n6 takes of &quot;Kiss Me, Baby&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0056aa895246b4409fe09f84c2c322d07d29799d","amp;dn":"Unsurpassed+Masters+Vol.+7+The+Alternate+%5C%22Today%5C%22+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0056aa895246b4409fe09f84c2c322d07d29799d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,86,170,137,82,70,180,64,159,224,159,132,194,195,34,208,125,41,121,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
