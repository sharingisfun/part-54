The stpry unfolds around Richard, a homicidal Undead Warlock, and Cale anon an elve of some kind that wants to better the world.\nThe humor is pretty dark at times but the comic is pretty damn addictive.\n\nThis is my first torrent so any feedback about errors or problems about the torrent would be appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58f22ecb97b63db6bdf0e53d7ff989a6b42d7746","amp;dn":"LFG+looking+for+group+page+1+-+159","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58f22ecb97b63db6bdf0e53d7ff989a6b42d7746","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,242,46,203,151,182,61,182,189,240,229,61,127,249,137,166,180,45,119,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
