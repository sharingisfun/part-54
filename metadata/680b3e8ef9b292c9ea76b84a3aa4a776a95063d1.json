Street Racing will put you in the seat of one of 10 stock import cars challenging you to seek out random street races at nighttime, earning parts and cars.\n\nYou will slowly mold your vehicle into a finely tuned racing machine, capable of taking anything on the streets, but it won?t be easy. There are many other racers out there with these same aspirations, willing to do whatever it takes to get the checkered flag.\n\nThe player will still be able to disassemble, repair, and upgrade their vehicle part by part. From bumpers to sway bars, nearly every possible part that is found on an actual vehicle will not only be present in L.A. Street Racer, but removable, damageable, and upgradeable.\n\nA detailed city will resemble the feeling of Los Angeles, with diversified roadways, corners, and intersections that made the dynamic street races a possibility.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:680b3e8ef9b292c9ea76b84a3aa4a776a95063d1","amp;dn":"L.A.+Street+Racing","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"680b3e8ef9b292c9ea76b84a3aa4a776a95063d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,11,62,142,249,178,146,201,234,118,184,74,58,164,167,118,169,80,99,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
