Even the gorgeous jacket photo of &amp;quot;exotica girl&amp;quot; Sandy Warner peeking out from a bamboo curtain is a classic of the era. With all this going for it, it almost seems unnecessary to point out that half of the tunes are from Les Baxter's tremendous &amp;quot;tone poem&amp;quot; Ritual of the Savage, itself an early classic of exotica. All of the tracks are solid and appropriate. Oddly enough, the record reflects Liberty Records' refusal to release its monaural recordings in electronically simulated stereo. The original, monaural version of the LP was recorded before stereo records were produced. That version features Arthur Lyman (still fresh after drunkenly discovering the allure of birdcalls) and is considered brighter, wilder, and more interesting than the stereo re-recording. The stereo version features Lyman's replacement on vibraphone, Julius Wechter (later founder of the astoundingly boring Baja Marimba Band). - Tony Wilds\n\nSession line-up:\nMartin Denny - piano, arranger\nArthur Lyman - vibes, xylophone, percussion\nJohn Kramer - string bass\nAugie Colon - bongos, congas, Latin effects, bird calls\nHarold Chang - drums, percussion\n\nenjoy and seed :)\n\n/owl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b26ec13e8b5bf7d87458137635984841f0632c92","amp;dn":"Martin+Denny+-+Exotica+I+%28Exotica-1957%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b26ec13e8b5bf7d87458137635984841f0632c92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,110,193,62,139,91,247,216,116,88,19,118,53,152,72,65,240,99,44,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
