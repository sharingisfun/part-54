Student arrives at new school, makes friends, hijinks ensue. It&amp;#039;s a formula that&amp;#039;s been worked to death, and Moyashimon follows a lot of the usual formula found in this genre. There&amp;#039;s the love interest(s), the wise but strange teacher, the eccentric friends, the coping with change, and so on and so forth. Sawaki&amp;#039;s special ability serves little to no plot purpose. If you&amp;#039;re looking for a unique and gripping story then you&amp;#039;re better off elsewhere.\n\nMoyashimon never quite takes itself seriously; and this is why the show exudes fun from all its pores. From the OP animation to the Bacteria Theatre that ends each episode, the fun never lets off. There are so many moments of utter inappropriateness, from Itsuki&amp;#039;s action hero imitation at the first year lunch to the exploding surstromming at Hasegawa&amp;#039;s dinner, that I couldn&amp;#039;t help but laugh at the way the show is presented. It&amp;#039;s a hoot and laughter is always just right around the corner, and I find it incredibly difficult to stop watching it, because I&amp;#039;m just having so damn much fun.\n\nWhat&amp;#039;s even more impressive is how it managed to mix in so much serious micro-bacteriology in the midst of it all, without ever seeming dull or uninteresting.\n\nIn some ways, Moyashimon feels a lot like Genshiken before Kio Shimoku decided that he&amp;#039;s sick and tired of making fun of otakus and started creating serious drama between his characters. It also feels like Honey and Clover when it&amp;#039;s not being dramatic (think the omakes, or the Twister game), except Moyashimon is always like that. Even when Misato and Kawahama are seriously discussing Kawaki&amp;#039;s problem and how Hasegawa and Itsuki may react to it, the show never forgets to have fun.\n----\nDescription taken from THAT Animeblog. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://that.animeblogger.net/2008/02/13/how-much-fun-would-a-bacteria-chuck-if-a-bacteria-could-chuck-fun/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://that.animeblogger.net/2008/02/13/how-much-fun-would-a-bacteria-chuck-if-a-bacteria-could-chuck-fun/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:765aad250bff8badf96694d54e81adc706450014","amp;dn":"Moyashimon+%5Bmp4%2Ciphone+ready%5D%5BDF%5D%5BBSS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"765aad250bff8badf96694d54e81adc706450014","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,90,173,37,11,255,139,173,249,102,148,213,78,129,173,199,6,69,0,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
