The half-grown cubs are learning the hunting and fighting skills they\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;ll need as adults. The cameras also give an insight into the worlds of other animals, with leopards presenting a real threat to the growing cubs, and deer making good hunting practice. The tigers head to a water hole to cool off on a steaming hot day, and the spy-cams show that the jungle pools are a magnet for a whole array of forest animals, including wild boars and sloth bears. But disaster strikes when both the cubs\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039; parents are injured and a rogue male puts in an appearance.\n \nNOTE VLC MEDIA PLAYER NEEDED\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9c3493a08c79c5dcfde5c36b18c4e5bb261c7d0","amp;dn":"BBC+Tiger+Spy+InT+hE+jUNGLE+3OF+3+2008+xvid+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9c3493a08c79c5dcfde5c36b18c4e5bb261c7d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,195,73,58,8,199,156,93,207,222,92,54,177,140,78,91,178,97,199,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
