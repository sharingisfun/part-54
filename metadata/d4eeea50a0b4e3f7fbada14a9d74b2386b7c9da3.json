Plot outline ....\n\nDetermined to find out the true effects of marijuana on the\nhuman body, stand-up comedian and former Stoner of the Year\nDoug Benson documents his experience avoiding pot for 30\ndays and then consuming massive amounts of the drug for\n30 days. More than just an amusing story of one man's quest\nto get superhigh, this documentary also examines the hotly\ncontested debate over medical marijuana use.\n\nOddly this came with spanish idx subs while the english\nsubs were only available in closed captions there for both\nwere included.\n\nAs with many documentries this is mixed 30fps and 24fps\nmaterial. the vast majority of it is 30fps thus we encoded\nit as such to avoid most of the rip having a stutter\neffect.\n\nAEN AFFiNiTY ANGELiC EPiC FiCO FoV FUtV HAGGiS iLS\niNGOT MACRO SAiNTS TVA\n\nAnd you people, you know who you are.\n\nYou should  know  where to find us.
