I&amp;#039;ve included a text file with the conents of this CD so you can have a scan through at what is included without booting it up on an Amiga.\n\nLike the previous three CDs, this one includes a search engine not only for the titles held on this CD but also for the previous ones, so boot from this CD and you can then search and extract titles from the previous three CD&amp;#039;s (as long as you have the other CDs!).\n\nI was able to burn these images onto CD using an NEC burner and could read it both in Windows and on my A500+ with A570.\n\nThis one contains mainly AGA or stuff that wasn&amp;#039;t compatible with an A500+, quite a bummer at the time! \n\nIf this is popular then I&amp;#039;ll post the final CD I have in the series, so remember to leave comments if you want more :)\n\nThe first two CDs can be found here: http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3907988/Amiga_PD_CDs_-_17_Bit_Collection_A_amp_B\n\nAnd the third CD can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3960133/Amiga_PD_CD_-_17-Bit_-_The_Continuation_Disc&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/3960133/Amiga_PD_CD_-_17-Bit_-_The_Continuation_Disc&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c449637392975c52d4756f0b9329c507ffab049","amp;dn":"Amiga+PD+CD+-+17-Bit+-+Phase+Four","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c449637392975c52d4756f0b9329c507ffab049","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,68,150,55,57,41,117,197,45,71,86,240,185,50,156,80,127,250,176,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
