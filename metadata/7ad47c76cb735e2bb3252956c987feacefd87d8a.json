This entire review is devoted to Martin Lawrence. I have done more than 30 productions and never experienced the kind of treatment I received on this one. Let me list a few. The director, Gil Junger would rehearse a scene for hours only to overridden by Martin when he finally showed up on the set. Martin had a group of bodyguards that would push us all out of the way when he came on the set because he didn&amp;#039;t like to be touched. His doubles did most of his work. I give special credit to a fellow named Nixon who seemed to do most of the work. Martin only did closeups. He had a girl whose job it was to put on his scarf and earmuffs. He had a guy who followed him around to put a chair under him if he wanted to sit down. This is the most negative review I have ever written, but Martin Lawrence needs to be exposed for who he really is. \n\nAnyone who worked with him will agree.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ad47c76cb735e2bb3252956c987feacefd87d8a","amp;dn":"Black.Knight.2001.Xvid.DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ad47c76cb735e2bb3252956c987feacefd87d8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,212,124,118,203,115,94,43,179,37,41,86,201,135,254,172,239,216,125,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
