This game teaches you the ropes by focusing on the basicsÃƒÂ¢??from hole cards to the river to the flop. Featuring ring game, tournament play with rebuys, and multitable action, this version of Texas Hold &amp;#039;Em includes limit, pot-limit, and no-limit options. The smooth interface lets you concentrate on the cards, but the empty seats are a little creepy. And though this will help beginners, experienced players might find the AI a little too simplistic.\n\nSo really the basics for the installing is simpleÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦u just mount it with deamon tools and it will install, then you can start playing. It does not need to be cracked and you can play onlineÃƒÂ¢?Ã‚Â¦\n\nI really enjoyed playing this game and is takes very small memory= 65mb!!!\n\nDAN2die4(yesuknowme);-)\n\nP.s. i would have sent some screens but u can&amp;#039;t at piratebay..i will do it in the comments here below!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2325c120302f5851bac96efd08b67a950d5686a1","amp;dn":"Texas+Holdem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2325c120302f5851bac96efd08b67a950d5686a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,37,193,32,48,47,88,81,186,201,110,253,8,182,122,149,13,86,134,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
