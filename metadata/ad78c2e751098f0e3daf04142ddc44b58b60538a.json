Though he began writing it in 1966, before his first published novel, Carrie (1974), it wasn't published until 1977.\n\nDescription:\n\nIn quiet Placerville, Maine, a slightly twisted boy named Charles Decker holds the 24 other students of his algebra class at gunpoint after shooting 2 teachers.\nAbused by his father as a child, he describes the important parts of his life, and in the process, lets a lot of the students he holds hostage tell the rest of the class their &quot;Dirty Secrets&quot;. As things progress, the students become more and more responsive to their captor, all except Ted Jones. The students get their own back, and play one last nasty trick on another student before being released unharmed. \nBut Charles is out of luck...\n\nKing decided to pull Rage out of print, forever. He is afraid its depiction of school violence will further 'glorify' such acts of aggression.\n\n=&gt; I have also included the ebook.\n--------------------------------------------\n\nPLEASE SEED WHEN YOU FINISH THE DOWNLOAD.\n\nEnjoy!!\n\nGrab it from here, much faster download speed: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://hotfile.com/dl/1451793/cdfab8b/RB20Rage.zip.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://hotfile.com/dl/1451793/cdfab8b/RB20Rage.zip.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad78c2e751098f0e3daf04142ddc44b58b60538a","amp;dn":"Rage+-+Stephen+King+as+Richard+Bachman+%5BAudiobook%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad78c2e751098f0e3daf04142ddc44b58b60538a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,120,194,231,81,9,143,14,61,175,4,20,45,220,68,181,139,96,83,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
