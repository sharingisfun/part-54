After many attempts, only one experiment was successful and now the unsuccessful ones are given drugs every day to keep them from regressing into their animal forms. They are also controlled through shock therapy to keep them in order.\n\nHowever, one of the creatures has found a way to stop himself from receiving shock treatment and when he informs others of this, the animal hybrids break loose on the island.\n\nOne of Dr. Moreau&amp;#039;s allies is Dr. Montgomery, a physician gone mad with devotion to Moreau and intense drug abuse.\n\nUnited Nations negotiator Edward Douglas, the sole survivor of an airplane crash, is brought ashore on Moreau&amp;#039;s island ÃƒÂ¢?? against his better judgement ÃƒÂ¢?? by Dr. Montgomery, and eventually becomes his prisoner. Horrified by the doctor&amp;#039;s monstrous experiments and fearing for his own life, Douglas seeks the help of Moreau&amp;#039;s lovely daughter, Aissa, in escaping the island, but is foiled at every turn by Dr. Montgomery and his man-beast lackeys.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98433c9439b16203f920d5033b8862ae1e2f5e23","amp;dn":"Ostrov.doktora.Moro.DVDRip.by.Snus.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98433c9439b16203f920d5033b8862ae1e2f5e23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,67,60,148,57,177,98,3,249,32,213,3,59,136,98,174,30,47,94,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
