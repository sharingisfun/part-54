The interface is based on MadTracker and should be easy to use if you\\&amp;#039;ve been using trackers before.\n\nOne of the features is NSF-file exporting. That allows music created in this tracker to be played on the real hardware, or even for for use in your own NES-applications. If you want to export your music to normal wave or other PC-playable format, an external recorder (like Audacity) is needed.\n\nSome other features:\n * Full real-time emulation of all channels\n * Internal PCM to DPCM-sample converter\n * MIDI input devices are supported\n * NTSC &amp; PAL modes are both supported\n\nSource is available under the GNU General Public License.\n\nTHIS PACKAGE ALSO COINTAINS ADDITIONAL AUDIO SAMPLES AND A BRILLIANT TUTORIAL FOR TRACKER-MUSIC CREATION IN PDF FORMAT!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22f7ef2a59aa0aad00d72e619458aaec07b76967","amp;dn":"FamiTracker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22f7ef2a59aa0aad00d72e619458aaec07b76967","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,247,239,42,89,170,10,173,0,215,46,97,148,88,170,236,7,183,105,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
