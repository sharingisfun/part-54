Though the strength of his songwriting and his distinctively twisted vocals remain staples, here Lauderdale has recruited the most luminous musical lineup ever to back him. Legendary guitarist James Burton trades licks with pianist Glen D. Hardin, a fellow Elvis Presley alum, and Flying Burrito Brothers? steel ace Al Perkins, with Emmylou Harris, Patty Loveless, Buddy Miller, and Kelly Hogan all contributing background vocals. Highlights include breakup balladry (&quot;It?s Finally Sinking In&quot;), Western gallop (&quot;The Daughter of Majestic Sage&quot;), and, as a thematic change of pace, the intervention plea of &quot;Hitting It Hard.&quot; Lauderdale has never released an album that fails to satisfy, but the powerhouse backing makes this one exceptional.\n\n____________________________________________________________________\n\nARTiST: Jim Lauderdale &amp; The Dream Players\nALBUM: Honey Songs\nBiTRATE: 179kbps avg\nQUALiTY: EAC Secure Mode / LAME 3.97 Final / -V2 --vbr-new / 44.100Khz\nLABEL: Yep Roc\nGENRE: Country\nSiZE: 47.99 megs\nPLAYTiME: 0h 35min 45sec total\nRiP DATE: 2008-02-27\nSTORE DATE: 2008-02-19\n\nTrack List:\n--------\n01.

For Honey Songs, Lauderdale pulled together big\nname friends and session royalty for this album full of rambling, soon-to-be\ncountry classics. Legendary Elvis Presley guitarist James Burton is featured on\nlead guitar along with Springsteen&amp;#039;s E Street Band bassist, Gary Tallent. Flying\nBurrito Brother Al Perkins lays down timeless pedal and lap steel alongside the\npiano of superstar sideman Glen D. Hardin (Merle Haggard, Roy Orbison, Elvis\nPresley, Dean Martin). Holding down the backbeat for the Dream Players, drummer\nRon Tutt has to be the only man with the distinction of playing with both\nElvises - Presley and Costello. The big names don&amp;#039;t end with the instruments,\nbacking vocalists include Emmylou Harris (&quot;I&amp;#039;m Almost Back&quot;), Patty Loveless\n(&quot;Hittin&amp;#039; It Hard&quot;), Buddy Miller and Kelly Hogan.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b242cef8ee76609675f06f808d8fe3e7d548b4e6","amp;dn":"Jim+Lauderdale+%26+The+Dream+Players-Honey+Songs+%282008-VBR-Country","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b242cef8ee76609675f06f808d8fe3e7d548b4e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,66,206,248,238,118,96,150,117,240,111,128,141,143,227,231,213,72,180,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
