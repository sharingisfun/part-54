You will then be able to create a copy of the reconstructed RAID in an image file or on a physical drive.\n\nOnce you created an image you can use it for further data recovery processing with Runtime&amp;#039;s GetDataBack. If you create the image on another physical drive, you can process it with GetDataBack too or you might even be able to directly boot from it.\n\nRAID Reconstructor is Read-Only\n\nIt will not try to &quot;fix&quot; your RAID. It will merely create a copy of your RAID at another location. It will collect sector by sector from each single drive involved and write these sectors in the correct order to the designated destination. This process is also called &quot;de-striping&quot;.\n\nBecause one drive is redundant in RAID 5, it is sufficient to have one less than the original number of drives (N) in the array. RAID Reconstructor can recalculate the original data from the N-1 drives. For a RAID-0 (striped) array you will need both drives.\n\nThe RAID Reconstructor will recover both, hardware and software RAIDs. It will recover from broken Windows Dynamic Disk sets.\n\nSystem Requirements:\nPentium processor\n32 MB Ram\nWindows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000 or XP\nDisk controller card capable of handling all the drives in your RAID individually\nStorage space for holding the reconstructed RAID","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30d63d9bcc16ee8338a5f12d0e692a204b48c8c8","amp;dn":"RAID+Reconstructor+v3.33","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30d63d9bcc16ee8338a5f12d0e692a204b48c8c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,214,61,155,204,22,238,131,56,165,241,45,14,105,42,32,75,72,200,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
