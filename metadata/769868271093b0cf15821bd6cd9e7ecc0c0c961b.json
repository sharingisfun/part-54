The band leading the way in energising punk in a political sense was The Clash, who played an integral role in the Rock Against Racism movement (as did many other punk groups), taking the stage alongside groups like Aswad and further cementing the links between punk and reggae. Anarcho-punk bands like Crass also began to emerge, taking on board anti-nuclear and vegetarian causes in opposition to the right wing politics of Oi! Bands. We discuss the political confusion caused by the mass of ideas thrown into the air by punk.\n\nProgramme 6: Typical Girls\n\nWomen were finally seen as equal in the punk movement. If you could pick up a guitar and play it - great. If you could sing and form your own band, even better. Women were finally getting a voice and not just as backing singers. We look at the women who rocked and discuss the great female punk performers - Siouxsie, The Slits, Pauline Murray, Poly Styrene, Debbie Harry and the seminal Patti Smith - and find out how true the idea that punk emancipated women from rock's macho posturing really is.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA Riot Of Your Own Episode Five 2002 SVCD 25 minutes\nTypical Girls Episode Six 2002 SVCD 25 minutes\n\nThese are in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players.
