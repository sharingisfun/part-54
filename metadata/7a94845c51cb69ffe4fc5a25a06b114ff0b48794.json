This is done just to avoid having the sloppy DOS window in the background. Some AVs complain with it recognizing RunHiddenConsole.exe as a malicious/potentially harmful program as it can be used to hide malicious behaviours. If it&amp;#039;s your case, or just don&amp;#039;t trust in the first one, just use the second version.\n\n\nEnjoy and remember to seed... :o)\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a94845c51cb69ffe4fc5a25a06b114ff0b48794","amp;dn":"Perfect+Uninstaller+5.3+Portable","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a94845c51cb69ffe4fc5a25a06b114ff0b48794","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,148,132,92,81,203,105,255,228,252,90,37,160,107,17,79,240,180,135,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
