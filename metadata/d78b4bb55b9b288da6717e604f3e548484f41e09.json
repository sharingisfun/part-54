But the mining disturbs something in the ground and the miners begin to disappear. Most of the town flees except a small handful. The mine's owner arrives, Mr. Gummer (again played by Michael Gross). This Gummer is different than his descendant in that he does not even own a gun.\n  Well, Gummer and the remaining residents set out to check the mine over and then get rid of the &quot;dirt dragons&quot; via a skilled gunslinger. In the end everyone must pull together to end the menace.\n\n  Starring: Michael Gross, Sara Botsford, Billy Drago, Brent Roam, August Schellenberg.\n\n  Directed by: S.S.
