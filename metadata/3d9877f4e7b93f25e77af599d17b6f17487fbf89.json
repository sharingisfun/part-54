It&amp;#039;s also now available for $49.99 US MSRP in 18,000 retail stores including Best Buy, Fry&amp;#039;s, Target, Wal-Mart and Costco, at Buy.com and other e-tailers.\n\nNew ActiveCare won&amp;#039;t interrupt or slow you down\n\nThe irony about most products that supposedly speed up and fix PC problems is that these applications take up so many system resources that they can slow the PC down more than they speed it up. Some products also interrupt users with annoying schedulers, pop up messages and prompts that can cause the PC to freeze up or crash?contributing to the very problems that they&amp;#039;re supposed to help fix.\n\n&quot;We decided to take action with ActiveCare ? our new patent-pending technology that intelligently senses when your PC is on but not being used,&quot; said JJ Schoch, VP of Marketing, iolo technologies. &quot;The second you touch a key, it disappears!&quot;\n\n&quot;ActiveCare won&amp;#039;t accidentally interrupt you like an old-style scheduler. It only kicks into gear when the PC processor is idle, or you&amp;#039;re away from the desk. It&amp;#039;s like having a housekeeper that only comes to clean when you&amp;#039;re away. You&amp;#039;ll never notice it working and it won&amp;#039;t annoy you with interruptions or make your PC lock up and freeze. It only springs into action when there&amp;#039;s a real need.&quot;\n\nNew features in 8.0 also include:\n\nNew Visual Registry Optimization Tool ? Analyzes and graphically shows the fragmentation and waste within the Registry, removes this unnecessary bloat and defragments the registry to return it back to its original fast, efficient size and performance upon the next reboot, usually taking less than a minute.\n\nDriveSense ? A cool new visual &quot;window&quot; into the status of your hard drive. It visually shows what up to 46 SMART sensors in the hard drive are sensing, such as temperature settings.\n\nThe best of both worlds for both novices and advanced users\n\n    * Novices just hit &quot;Analyze/Repair&quot; ? With just one button, novices can automatically tune and maintain their PCs for peak performance and stability, or use ActiveCare to keep the PC tuned proactively and invisibly.\n    * Power users get Power Tools ? 40 cutting-edge tune-up, optimization, repair, and maintenance tools to go deep under the hood and squeeze extra horsepower out of their PC.\n\nWhy every PC needs a regular tune-up now more than ever\n\nJust as every Internet user needs antivirus to protect their PC, the demands of today&amp;#039;s resource-intensive applications make PC Tune-up the new must-have application for every PC to avoid crashes and slowdowns.\n\nIn fact, the more you use your PC, the slower it gets! The majority of computer slowdowns and problems are caused by errors, fragmentation and clutter that accumulate over time from normal everyday use. All computer users ? especially gamers and anyone using video-intensive applications?must frequently tune their PC. New System Mechanic 8 makes this second nature ? it tunes the PC silently and invisibly, without interrupting you.\n\nSystem Mechanic is a must-have product for anyone with a PC running the Microsoft Windows Ã‚Â® Vista operating system ? boosting internet speeds and boot time significantly. It also rejuvenates older XP or 2000 machines so they run like new.\n\nCurrently used by 18 million customers worldwide and trusted for 10 years, System Mechanic consistently receives rave reviews and major industry awards, including Laptop Magazine Editor&amp;#039;s Choice of 2008, CNET Editor&amp;#039;s Choice, and Computer Shopper&amp;#039;s Best Utility of 2007.\n\nAvailability\n\nSystem Mechanic 8 goes live today and current subscribers will automatically receive the new version within the next few weeks.
