As the war rages on, you will lead a squad of elite troopers deep behind enemy lines to perform secret missions and prevent a disaster the true scale of which could be fully appreciated by neither of the involved parties. Pick your mercenaries from a pool of more than 40 elite soldiers of 30 different nationalities. Equip your squad with over 75 authentic WWII weapons ranging from commando daggers to hand-held rocket launchers, including experimental and rare models. Be sure to assess your troopers&amp;#039; skills adequately before you embark on a mission: you&amp;#039;ll only be able to take five of them with you. Your objective is sabotage with no holds barred.\nSite of game - http://www.nival.ru/silentstorm/\n\n\nThe Game have RUSSIAN interface and ENGLISH sound!!\nTo install it run AUTORUN.exe and click INSTALL.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25c12f9f1905c933b9a3c7a9588f4e91c67bf970","amp;dn":"Silent+Storm+DVD+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25c12f9f1905c933b9a3c7a9588f4e91c67bf970","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,193,47,159,25,5,201,51,185,163,199,169,88,143,78,145,198,123,249,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
