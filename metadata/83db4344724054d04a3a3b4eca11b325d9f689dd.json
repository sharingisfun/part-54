Featuring Lamar Williams (bass), Jaimoe (drums) and Chuck Leavell (piano, keyboards, vocals), all then-members of the Allman Brothers, the trio would occasionally open shows for the group in 1975 and 1976. With the Allmans&amp;#039; first disbanding in 1976, the trio added guitarist Jimmy Nalls and named the band based on a phoenetic pun of their leader&amp;#039;s name (C. Leavell). They toured relentlessly, eventually signing with Capricorn Records (home of the Allman Brothers) and recording their debut album.\n\nThis is a vinyl rip from their 5 albums (and a bonus), processed to eliminate noise. The albums are:\n\nSea Level - 1977\nCats on the Coast - 1977\nOn the Edge - 1978\nLong walk on a short pier - 1979\nBall Room - 1980\n\nAnd a little live bonus.\n\nPlease enjoy, please comment and please seed.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:83db4344724054d04a3a3b4eca11b325d9f689dd","amp;dn":"Sea+Level-5+albums+and+a+bonus","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"83db4344724054d04a3a3b4eca11b325d9f689dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[131,219,67,68,114,64,84,208,74,58,59,78,202,17,179,37,217,246,137,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
