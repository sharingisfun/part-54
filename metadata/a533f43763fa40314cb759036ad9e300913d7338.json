Yes, it&amp;#039;s true, with unusual results.\nFirst issue is 157 with Gerber being listed as a co-author with Englehart.\nThen begins a short run of 221, 222, 223, and 225. I&amp;#039;ve omitted 244 because Gerber didn&amp;#039;t write it and missing it doesn&amp;#039;t cause any problems.\n\nThese come near the end of his first stint with Marvel. Perhaps there&amp;#039;s some tension being displayed by having Gerber listed in issue 225 as the &amp;#039;typist&amp;#039; instead of the writer.\n\nI&amp;#039;ve included issue 226 even though Gerber didn&amp;#039;t write it because 225 ends in such a cliff-hanger.\n\nAs always, thanks to the original uploaders. I took these from a huge Captain America torrent containing hundreds of issues.
