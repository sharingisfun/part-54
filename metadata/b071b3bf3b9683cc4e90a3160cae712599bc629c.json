IÃƒÂ¢??ve never found any Chad Mitchell Trio torrents, but back when the napsterclones ruled p2p, it was occasionally possible to grab the odd song. So, this collection isnÃƒÂ¢??t by any means COMPLETE, but it is a fairly decent introduction to a good folk trio from the 60s that specialized in some funny songs. If you have never heard of these guys and donÃƒÂ¢??t want this torrent because you are worried itÃƒÂ¢??s another lame ass Peter Paul and Mary group, try listening to Lizzie Borden, Super Skier, or Your Friendly, Liberal Neighborhood Ku Klux Klan. Spread your wings a little and try comedy from another age ÃƒÂ¢?? you just might be surprised.\n\nAllmusic entry - http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:dl7zefykhgfj~T1\n\nWiki - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chad_Mitchell_Trio\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b071b3bf3b9683cc4e90a3160cae712599bc629c","amp;dn":"Chad+Mitchell+Trio+-+60s+folk%2C+comedy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b071b3bf3b9683cc4e90a3160cae712599bc629c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,113,179,191,59,150,131,204,78,144,163,22,12,174,113,37,153,188,98,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
