Strategy is paramount to success; careful skill management, equipment selection and magic usage will win your fights, not rapid button clicking. We are very pleased to say this is not another &quot;action RPG&quot;.\n\n Hundreds of items and dozens of creatures await your discovery. A combination of randomly generated treasure and carefully hidden goodies means that no two games will play the exact same way.\n\n Unlimited character development style: Choose from 24 unique skills to make the character you want and 8 base attributes that affect your character&amp;#039;s every action throughout the game. The game world does not scale or adjust itself to match anyone&amp;#039;s play style, so the ease or difficulty of the game is directly related to how successful you are at developing your character.\n\n Combat plays out at your pace. Eschalon: Book I features a turn-based system that allows you to roll through combat as fast or slow you want...make it fast and furious, or analyze every option for maximum advantage.\n\n A non-linear storyline means that the game world is open to explore as you desire. Follow the storyline or don&amp;#039;t...it&amp;#039;s up to you. Just be careful where you go and who you choose to trust- the world of Eschalon can be a deadly place for an inexperienced adventurer.\n\n An epic adventure that you must face alone...a single-player RPG carefully designed to feel like the great old school RPGs of the past such as Ultima, Might &amp; Magic, and Wizardry.\n\n\nYou can find all our great releases by searching:[Manical]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0996d129a0336faadf188fd907759edb0845d1d3","amp;dn":"%28PC%29+Eschalon+Book+I+-+Retail+ISO-+All+OSes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0996d129a0336faadf188fd907759edb0845d1d3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,150,209,41,160,51,111,170,223,24,143,217,7,117,158,219,8,69,209,211]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
