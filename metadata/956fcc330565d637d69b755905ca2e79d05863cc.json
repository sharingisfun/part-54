(Can&amp;#039;t have the Pirate Bay users stuck on a instrumental RickRoll!)\n\nNOTES:\n*Only the 1st, 2nd, and 4th zones in the 1P/Co-op level list work. The others do not have maps outside of the internal betas. Even then, those maps are NOT changed from their 1.09.4 variations.\n*This should not be installed over a normal SRB2 install.\n*WADs cannot be added.\n*All characters can now go Super.\n*If you change your name to &quot;Spazzo&quot;, all of the game&amp;#039;s music will be replaced by an instrumental version of Never Gonna Give You Up by Rick Astley, which is the famous RickRoll song. Delete your gamedata.dat file in your SRB2 folder to reset the soundtrack. If you just wanna hear the song, use the console command &quot;TUNES 22&quot;.\n*The Match, Tag, Team Match, and CTF systems have been completely remade. Play the game to figure that out.\n*READ THE SRB2 MANUAL AT http://ssntails.sepwich.com/srb2/manual/manual.htm IT IS FOR 1.09.4, BUT ENOUGH APPLIES TO THIS VERSION THAT IT SHOULD BE READ.\n\nHave fun,\nXeroSHINE\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:956fcc330565d637d69b755905ca2e79d05863cc","amp;dn":"Sonic+Robo+Blast+2+Private+Beta+1.10.3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"956fcc330565d637d69b755905ca2e79d05863cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,111,204,51,5,101,214,55,214,155,117,89,5,202,46,121,208,88,99,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
