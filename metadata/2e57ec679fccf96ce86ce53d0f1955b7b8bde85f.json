In only three months, one million people were brutally murdered. In the face of these unspeakable actions, inspired by his love for his family, an ordinary man summons extraordinary courage to save the lives of over a thousand helpless refugees, by granting them shelter in the hotel he manages.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e57ec679fccf96ce86ce53d0f1955b7b8bde85f","amp;dn":"Hotel+Rwanda+%282004%29+PAL+DVD9","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e57ec679fccf96ce86ce53d0f1955b7b8bde85f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,87,236,103,159,204,249,108,232,108,229,61,15,25,85,183,184,189,232,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
