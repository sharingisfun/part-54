It is one of the specifics of jazz that the very features of that music which characterize it best and which differentiate it most ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ despite its extreme variety ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ from other music, are even more resistant, in the various stages of their developÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ment, to attempts at describing them in forÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬malized terms than other kinds of creative effort. To be sure, special instructional material and exclusively jazz-oriented instruction have been making some progress recently, but such practice is not yet wide-spread, and attempts at commuÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬nicating methodically the very essentials of jazz music continue to have to do with a trial-and--error approach. This means, in effect, that it is impossible to synthesize jazz expression merely through the study of theory and instruÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬mental techniques, no matter how specialized the study. After all, jazz musicians shape their mode of expression primarily in living contact with the actual sound of jazz music, i. e. by sensitively listening to its various elements as well as the final integrated sound units; by practising them on their own instruments or in group playing they keep developing their individual abilities. The most frequent instrucÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬tional material in that respect are sound recordÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ings of performances by the accomplished masters of that music; yet the absolutely most valuable source of knowledge and practical\n \nexperience remains the opportunity to play \\&quot;live\\&quot; with one of the jazz greats.\nThat was why, after some ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ not very extensive ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ meetings with a few major jazz musicians, we took the bold step to arrange for an opporÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬tunity to collaborate actively for a few days, both privately and in public, with one of the prominent classical personalities of traditional jazz, with a man who helped to shape that music and who played with the best of his generation, such as Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, and Jerry Roll Morton. Our daring attempt fortunaÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬tely succeeded, and in April 1972 we welcomed as our celebrated guest the outstanding Creole clarinet player, a native of New Orleans, Albert  Nicholas.\nHe was born 27 May 1900; by a strange coincÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬idence, many of his future New Orleans partÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ners were born that year, including Armstrong. A member of the Creole section of the New Orleans population which had inherited from the European element of its ancestry a relatively powerful inclination towards Latin culture, Nicholas embraced from the very outset that of the two main streams of New Orleans jazz which is made sophisticatedly elegant by its easy flow and emphasis on melody and which is somewhat calmer than the more impetuous and more spontaneous Negro stream represented by Armstrong. His clarinet playing profited most\n \nfrom the art of the earliest known Creole clarinet players in New Orleans jazz, Lorenzo Tio Sr., Lorenzo Tio Jr., and Big Eye Nelson. Nicholas later found more varied sources of inspiration, and he worked with almost all proÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬minent jazz musicians of his generation, by no means merely those of New Orleans extraction; still later, he became gladly accepted by muÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬sicians much younger than himself, and that popularity continued. In addition to the jazzmen mentioned above, his co-players included, before World War I, Joe King Oliver and Edward Kid Ory, and between the two wars Fats Waller, Barney Bigard, Louis Russell, Paul Barbarin, Chick Webb and others. At that time he also went on extended tours to China, India and Egypt with Jack Carter\\'s orchestra. In World War II he worked for some time on a postal boat and as subway ticket controller. After World War II, he added Art Hodes, Bunk John-son, Ralph Sutton, Rex Stewart, Mezz Mezzrow and others to his already broad circle of co--players. He first visited Europe in 1952, and he worked there continuously for seven years, mostly in France, and there mostly in Paris. After a short trip back to America he settled permanently in Europe in 1959. His principal partner during his initial stay in Paris was Andre Reweliotty, and later also his old New Orleans colleague, Sidney Bechet, by that time\n \nalso a permanent expatriate in Paris. In 1968, Albert Nicholas again changed his domicile, this time to Basle, Switzerland, That year also marked his first visit to Czechoslovakia ÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¿Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â½ to Bratislava where he had been invited by young local musicians specializing in traditional jazz.\nThe selection of themes for this recording was made under Albert Nicholas\\' guidance. In the expression-rich \\&quot;Albert\\'s Blues\\&quot;, his authorship extended mostly to his own broad improvisation, with economical accompaniment by all instruÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™?ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¬ments in the orchestra; Nicholas entrusted the orchestration to Antonin Bily, the Traditional Jazz Studio\\'s permanent pianist.\nIn addition to the permanent members of the Traditional Jazz Studio, this recording features several well-known Prague musicians; we believed that their individual excellence was certain to make a special contribution to such interesting collaboration. They are Ludek Hulan (bass), Petr Skocdopole (piano), and Vaclav Fiala (trombone). It goes without saying, of course, that the honour to play with Albert Nicholas also meant enrichment of oneself. Unfortunately, his death in 1973 put an end to such visits and meant a great loss to our musicians and their art.\nPavel Smetacek\n \n\n \nRECORDED AT THE SUPRAPHON \\'\\'MOZARTEUM\\&quot; STUDIO, PRAGUE, ON 23/24 APRIL, 1972\n \nRecording directors:\nTony Matzner and Kvetoslav Rohleder\nRecording engineer: Jan Chalupsky\n \n Zdenek Ziegler 1973  Jiri Janecka 1973 Pavel Smetacek 1973\n \nMADE IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA ARTIA PRAGUE\nPrinted by Severografia Cerveny Kostelec\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f92be583d2219e13bcd259f8ac40627ad591819e","amp;dn":"Albert+Nicholas+%26+The+Traditional+Jazz+Studio+1972++Albert","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f92be583d2219e13bcd259f8ac40627ad591819e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,43,229,131,210,33,158,19,188,210,89,248,172,64,98,122,213,145,129,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
