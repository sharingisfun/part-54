After witnessing the death of his father in a car \naccident, he becomes sullen and withdrawn. This leads to him being put under house \narrest after he punches out an unsympathetic teacher. Imprisoned in his own house, \nand unable to go beyond 100 yards, he finds himself turning into a peeping tom and \nspying on all the neighbors. One of them is the attractive new girl in town named \nAshley (Sarah Roemer) and another may be a killer named Mr. Turner (David Morse). \nWith the help of the new girl Ashley, his friend Ronnie (a great comedic turn by A\naron Yoo), Kale goes about investigating Mr. Turner to see if he is the killer or not. \nThe three teenagers use cell phones and the internet as well as video cameras in \nthe investigation, and DJ Caruso shows some of his sly wit by using these same devices\n in the film to not only investigate the spooky neighbor, but also to create some humor\n to go along with everything else.\n\nThe plot is a familiar one. That would be because the great Alfred Hitchcock used it\n first with his famous suspense thriller Rear Window. Yes Disturbia is a blatant\n rip-off of that movie, but it is done with skill, and the acting by all, \nincluding Carrie Anne Moss as Kale&amp;#039;s mother, was very good. \nAll the characters are likable, and David Morse&amp;#039;s turn as the creepy Mr. \nTurner was well done as well.\n\nDisturbia may not be a great movie, but it is definitely one of the best \nPG13 thrillers in years. It outshines such horror thrillers as Cursed and Pulse, \nas well as the recent horror thriller The Messengers. Disturbia also once again proves \nthat you don&amp;#039;t need a bunch of gore to make an effective horror thriller. Horror directors \ntake note. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1baa23443c8c63005eb7f880f704ab2334d68ca6","amp;dn":"Disturbia+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1baa23443c8c63005eb7f880f704ab2334d68ca6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,170,35,68,60,140,99,0,94,183,248,128,247,4,171,35,52,214,140,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
