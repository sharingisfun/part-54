It was written by Randall M. Badat and Rob Kerchner and is being directed by Stuart Gillard. Production began on November 20, 2006 in Montreal, and the film is expected to be released July 29, 2008. According to MGM&amp;#039;s original press release, the film is budgeted as one in a series of direct-to-DVD sequels.\n\nThe movie will star Matt Lanter as a computer whiz named Will Farmer who engages a government super-computer named R.I.P.L.E.Y. in an online terrorist-attack simulation game. Little does he know that the online game he plays is actually part of a sophisticated piece of government spyware designed to find potential terrorists. Homeland Security, now believing Farmer to be a terrorist, sets out to apprehend him.\n\nIn a nod to the original film, the games listed available to play are the same. An example of this is Global Thermonuclear War, which was the game Matthew Broderick&amp;#039;s character played.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:540f63eb7c7f8384e68b77a5d0c781225540ac42","amp;dn":"WarGames_The_Dead_Code_%5B2008%5DDvDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"540f63eb7c7f8384e68b77a5d0c781225540ac42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,15,99,235,124,127,131,132,230,139,119,165,208,199,129,34,85,64,172,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
