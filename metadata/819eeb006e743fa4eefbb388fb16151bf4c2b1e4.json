Not that horrendous \\&quot;I-hope-the-girls-like-it\\&quot; crap like The Strokes. No! This is REAL rock! The kind that makes you envision crushed beer cans, sticky floors, cigarette smoke and drunk rowdy nights! You just don\\&amp;#039;t hear rock like this anymore! These guys sing about getting trashed, doing cocaine, swearing at the man...etc. All while providing simple rocking chords. Genius! Great music for a party, or if you want to go destroy something. If you\\&amp;#039;ve seen Super Troopers, then you\\&amp;#039;ve heard of the Unband. \n\nRock Out!!!\n\n\n\n\n14 tracks @ 320kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:819eeb006e743fa4eefbb388fb16151bf4c2b1e4","amp;dn":"The+Unband+-+Retarder+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"819eeb006e743fa4eefbb388fb16151bf4c2b1e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,158,235,0,110,116,63,164,238,251,179,136,251,22,21,27,244,194,177,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
