But I have the full image as ÃƒÂ¢??preview areaÃƒÂ¢?? and can change the values as long and often as I want.\n\nEach of the layers can be further modified with the curves tool, other tools or partially masked off. DonÃƒÂ¢??t forget to make a safety copy of the layer.\n\nThe image on the top of this page was done in this way. ItÃƒÂ¢??s an enhanced version of the one I showed in the video. I have added a masked red layer for the background and a bit red layer for all of the image. This version is in the files for downloading - just two layers more than in the video.\n\nThe challenge\n\nYou can use this technique in the current challenge. Do a monochrome conversion with GIMP, post the image in the meetthegimp.org photogroup at 23 and be sure to use the tag ÃƒÂ¢??mtg-monochromeÃƒÂ¢??. The challenge ends March 31 1600GMT and IÃƒÂ¢??ll draw a winner by random choice.\n\nYou can find the image used in this episode here on the Download Page\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d504d59256dc4c4b2365ba5f5c7daf0159531b74","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_034_Monochrome%283%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d504d59256dc4c4b2365ba5f5c7daf0159531b74","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,4,213,146,86,220,76,75,35,101,186,95,92,125,175,1,89,83,27,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
