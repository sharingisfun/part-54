They formed in February 1997 and set about learning their trade through non-stop performances on the Irish circuit. In September 1999, they released their debut single &amp;quot;Successful Everyday Living&amp;quot; on Dublin independent label Treasure Island Records. This received positive reviews from both mainstream press and underground fanzines alike. This sold relatively well for an Irish punk band and established Mixtwitch on a serious footing within the Irish music scene. It was also A-listed by Phantom FM, DublinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s premier alternative music station and played occasionally on commercial radio stations.\n\n\nIn 2001 alone Mixtwitch played over 50 gigs in 5 different countries. At home they played a number of all ages shows around the country and supported some of their favourite bands such as Reel Big Fish, Capdown, Frenzal Rhomb and the Mad Caddies. They did a short tour of England with Turtlehead and returned to play in Scotland with them and Consumed. They also ventured to the East Coast of America to play in August, ending the year on the aforementioned Moon Ska tour of England and Germany.\n\nIn September 2002, after a successful UK tour with New York trad-ska band The Slackers, Mixtwitch released their 2nd album &amp;quot;Smile for the Money Shot&amp;quot;, this time throughout Europe on Moon Ska Records. The band then embarked on a mammoth 36-date tour of the UK with 4 ft. Fingers, Whitmore and Gash. This &amp;quot;GolfinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ on the Moon&amp;quot; tour raised the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s profile in Britain significantly. Again the album reviews from Ireland, the UK, Europe and America have been extremely positive. The album received the endorsement of the likes of Hot Press, Kerrang!and Maximum Rock Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Roll. Radio in Ireland has also been supportive with the album being recommended by 2 FM and the track &amp;quot;Gifted&amp;quot; making Phantom FMÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s A-list and top 10. In the UK, BBC and Total Rock Radio have also given Mixtwitch airplay.\n\nWith the launch of P-Rock TV in November 2002, Mixtwitch reached a massive ever-growing new audience as the intro to live favourite &amp;quot;Gifted&amp;quot; was used as the theme song to the channelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s chart show. In early 2003 Mixtwitch continued playing high profile shows in Ireland with Good Charlotte, Finch and Steve-O of MTV Jackass fame. In March 2003 Mixtwitch made a video for album closer &amp;quot;Continue the Research&amp;quot; which was aired on P-Rock just in time for the hugely successful sold-out 29-date &amp;quot;Over the Moon&amp;quot; U.K. tour with Whitmore, Sola Beat Alliance and Graveltrap, which ran until May 2003.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8d953fcc41d74f772caf1d15a46e637b6824104","amp;dn":"Mixtwitch+-+Smile+For+The+Money+Shot+-+%28Ska+Punk+Rock%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8d953fcc41d74f772caf1d15a46e637b6824104","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,217,83,252,196,29,116,247,114,202,241,209,90,70,230,55,182,130,65,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
