Another, for skimming bingo profits. And the third, for a career-ending drunken joyride. \n\nMeeting daily in the prison law library, taking exercise walks in their boxer shorts, these judges-turned-felons can reminisce about old court cases, dispense a little jailhouse justice, and contemplate where their lives went wrong.\n\nOr they can use their time in prison to get very rich -- very fast. And so they sit, sprawled in the prison library, furiously writing letters, fine-tuning a wickedly brilliant extortion scam ... while events outside their prison walls begin to erupt. \n\nA bizarre presidential election is holding the nation in its grips -- and a powerful government figure is pulling some very hidden strings. For the Brethren, the timing couldn&amp;#039;t be better. Because they&amp;#039;ve just found the perfect victim... \n\n&quot;Gripping ... engaging and fast-paced ... will hook you from the first page and won&amp;#039;t let you go.&quot;ÃƒÂ¢??New York Post\n\n&quot;A crackerjack tale.&quot;ÃƒÂ¢??Entertainment Weekly \n\n&quot;Fast-paced and action-packed...you&amp;#039;ll be thoroughly entertained.&quot;ÃƒÂ¢??New Orleans Times-Picayune\n\n&quot;The plot is as up-to-date as tomorrow&amp;#039;s newspaper, with allusions to presidential polls and debates, campaign financing, money laundering and offshore financial finagling.... Add to these tantalizing ingredients the steady action, with some clever surprises.&quot; ÃƒÂ¢??The New York Times\n\nA Main Selection of the Doubleday Book Club, the Literary Guild, and the Mystery Guild","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5b463679c42bc12f4333fe53c75fbe52713bcb4","amp;dn":"John+Grisham+-+The+Brethren+128k","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5b463679c42bc12f4333fe53c75fbe52713bcb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,180,99,103,156,66,188,18,244,51,63,229,60,117,251,229,39,19,188,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
