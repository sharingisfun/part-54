The first single from the album, the cloyingly wise &quot;Better Get to Livin&amp;#039;,&quot; is certainly catchy enough, but the fact remains that Parton&amp;#039;s voice isn&amp;#039;t quite what it used to be and she wasn&amp;#039;t exactly Patsy Cline in the first place. What she is, and has been all these years, is a true iconic presence in country music, a shrewd marketer, an astute businesswoman (Backwoods Barbie appears from her own Dolly Records), and a frequently brilliant if understated songwriter (nine of the 12 tracks here are Parton originals). Unlike her last couple of albums, which were bluegrass-based, she isn&amp;#039;t trying to reinvent herself here, but works in her usual pop and country hybrid style (even tenderly covering Smokey Robinson&amp;#039;s &quot;The Tracks of My Tears&quot;), not trying too hard to be contemporary, although the production touches are there (the album was co-produced by Parton and her bandleader, guitarist Kent Wells), certainly, and her version of Betsy Ulmer and Craig Wiseman&amp;#039;s &quot;Jesus &amp; Gravity,&quot; even more than &quot;Better Get to Livin&amp;#039;,&quot; could well find itself in regular rotation on new country radio stations, at least in a fair and equitable world. Other highlights here include the title song, which shows Parton still in tune with her public image (she really always has been, of course), and the beautiful and delicate original &quot;Only Dreamin&amp;#039;,&quot; which shows that, beneath all the big wigs and glamour, Parton is still a fine songwriter with an uncommon sense of grace, economy, and wisdom. Backwoods Barbie might not break the bank out there, and it would take a good deal of marketing and luck for any of these tracks to hit the top of the new country charts, but it shows that Parton can still deliver the package in fine style and only the fools among us would ever count her down and out, no matter how many bluegrass albums she does. [The Target Exclusive edition adds live versions of &quot;Jolene&quot; and &quot;Two Doors Down&quot; as bonus tracks.] \n\n[code]\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n\n                Dolly Parton - Backwoods Barbie (Retail)\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n\n\n   Artist  : Dolly Parton\n   Album   : Backwoods Barbie (Retail)\n\n   Genre   : Country\n   Label   : Dolly Rec.\n\n   Source  : CDDA\n   Size    : 70,4 MB\n\n   Quality : VBRkbps\n           : 44.1kHz\n           : Joint\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n\n   Tracklist:\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n\n   01    Better Get To Livin&amp;#039;                                     03:36\n   02    Made Of Stone                                            04:13\n   03    Drives Me Crazy                                          04:12\n   04    Backwoods Barbie                                         03:19\n   05    Jesus &amp; Gravity                                          04:40\n   06    Only Dreamin&amp;#039;                                            05:36\n   07    The Tracks Of My Years                                   03:34\n   08    The Lonesomes                                            03:18\n   09    Cologne                                                  03:42\n   10    Shinola                                                  04:12\n   11    I Will Forever Hate Roses                                03:26\n   12    Somebody&amp;#039;s Everything                                    04:22\n   13    Jolene (Bonus)                                           03:05\n   14    Two Doors Down (Bonus)                                   02:15\n\n                                                   Total Runtime: 53:30\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n\n   Release Notes:\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n\n        ours has higher bitrates + 2 extra tracks hence the need\n        for a retail release :)  thanks to the others for getting \n        the advance out first tho.\n\n        The inaugural release on her own Dolly Records finds the \n        ever-mercurial Dolly Parton moving away from the \n        bluegrass/acoustic-oriented sound she explored on her \n        albums for the Sugar Hill label from 1999 to 2005. Never \n        content to stay in one place, she traverses a wide array of \n        styles on BACKWOODS BARBIE. Opening track &quot;Better Get to \n        Livin&amp;#039;&quot; has an anthemic, contemporary-country feel that&amp;#039;s \n        overtly radio-friendly. The jazzy, piano-flecked &quot;The \n        Lonesomes&quot; adds an easy swing to the proceedings. &quot;I Will \n        Forever Hate Roses&quot; and &quot;Made of Stone&quot; offer proof that \n        Dolly still has a way with a good old country ballad.\n\n        While most of the tunes on BACKWOODS BARBIE (including the \n        incisive, autobiographical title track) come from Parton&amp;#039;s \n        own pen, she shows her customary flair for covers as well, \n        lending a surprising folk-pop flavor to the Fine Young \n        Cannibals&amp;#039; &amp;#039;80s dance-pop hit &quot;She Drives Me Crazy&quot; and \n        putting a touch of twang into Smokey Robinson&amp;#039;s classic \n        soul ballad &quot;Tracks of My Tears.&quot; Even in her sixties, the \n        country icon shows no signs of settling into a rut.\n\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n\n             EON : BRINGING THE BEST FROM THE BEST TO YOUR EARDRUMS\n   ____________________________________________________________________\n[/code]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eaa5f1d31649b66710eaebdccb6a3f320c9e1853","amp;dn":"Dolly+Parton-Backwoods+Barbie+%282008-Limited+Target+Edition%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eaa5f1d31649b66710eaebdccb6a3f320c9e1853","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,165,241,211,22,73,182,103,16,234,235,220,203,106,63,50,12,158,24,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
