These were removed in the\n       Final Fantasy Chronicles version, and the game was re-localized, achieving a\n       script closer to the Japanese script by Takashi Tokita. Chrono Trigger, released\n       in 1995, was already localized by Ted Woolsey, but the Final Fantasy Chronicles\n       version has a few modifications.\n\n       A primary addition to both games is full-motion video. Final Fantasy IV features\n       computer graphic sequences, while Chrono Trigger features anime-style sequences\n       designed by Akira Toriyama that \\&quot;help further tell the story of Chrono Trigger.\\&quot;\n       Final Fantasy IV was given gameplay features such as a two-player mode, a\n       \\&quot;Sprint Feature\\&quot; to \\&quot;enhance and quicken gameplay\\&quot;, and the \\&quot;Memo File\\&quot; system\n       to \\&quot;reduce saving time.\\&quot; Chrono Trigger, instead of added gameplay features, has\n       an \\&quot;Extras Mode\\&quot;. This features databases such as a bestiary and a gallery of\n       artwork created in development.\n\n\n          [ABOUT]\n       Final Fantasy Chronicles is a compilation of Square\\&amp;#039;s console role-playing games\n       Final Fantasy IV and Chrono Trigger, released for the Sony PlayStation on\n       June 29, 2001. TOSE ported both titles from the Super Nintendo Entertainment\n       System; each had been previously released as individual PlayStation ports in\n       1997 (Final Fantasy IV) and 1999 (Chrono Trigger). Several bonus features were\n       added to each game, such as art galleries, bestiaries, and cutscenesÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¹including\n       computer-generated full motion video used at the beginning of Final Fantasy IV\n       and anime scenes used throughout Chrono Trigger.\n\n          [SIZE]\n       315 MB - Chrono Trigger\n       253 MB - Final Fantasy 4\n\n\n         GAME SYNOPSiS\n      \\&amp;#039;*~.~*\\&amp;#039;*~.~*\\&amp;#039;*~.~*\\&amp;#039;\n\n        CHRONO  TRIGGER\n      \\&amp;#039;*~.~*\\&amp;#039;*~.~*\\&amp;#039;*~.~*\\&amp;#039;\n       Chrono Trigger begins with the 1000 A.D. Millennial Fair, where Crono and Marle\n       sample Lucca\\&amp;#039;s new teleportation device. Marle volunteers, but disappears\n       through a strange portal when the machine reacts with her pendant. Crono asks\n       to be sent through the machine to find her, and discovers he\\&amp;#039;s traveled back\n       400 years. He meets Marle at Guardia Castle, and learns that a search party\n       looking for the missing queen of that era found her instead.[11] Marle then\n       vanishes; Lucca arrives and claims that she\\&amp;#039;s actually the princess of Guardia\n       in 1000 A.D., and that since her ancestor was not rescued, Marle ceased to\n       exist. With the help of a talking amphibian called Frog, Crono and Lucca rescue\n       the real Queen, kidnapped by \\&quot;Mystics\\&quot; who worship the wizard Magus. Marle\n       reappears and the group returns to 1000 A.D., where Crono is placed on trial for\n       allegedly kidnapping Marle. He\\&amp;#039;s sentenced to death, but breaks free from the\n       prison. With Marle and Lucca, he flees the king, to nearby Guardia Forest, where\n       they stumble into a time gate.\n\n       READ MORE AT http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrono_Trigger#Story\n\n        FINAL FANTASY 4\n      \\&amp;#039;*~.~*\\&amp;#039;*~.~*\\&amp;#039;*~.~*\\&amp;#039;\n       Final Fantasy IV begins with the unmatched monarchy of Baron using the Red Wings\n       to attack peaceful nations and find four powerful Crystals that correspond to the\n       classical elements. Cecil questions the king\\&amp;#039;s motives after stealing the Water\n       Crystal from the wizards\\&amp;#039; town of Mysidia, murdering several in the process.\n       He is stripped of his rank and sent with Kain to deliver a package to the Village\n       of Mist. To reach the mountain valley where the Village is located, the two\n       traverse the Mist Cave and defeat the Mist Dragon that guards it. Upon reaching\n       the village, they discover the package is actually a bomb, which explodes,\n       resulting in the destruction of the town and the death of many of its inhabitants.\n       In the ensuing chaos, Cecil and Kain encounter Rydia, a young female survivor\n       standing over her mother\\&amp;#039;s body. Rydia\\&amp;#039;s mother was spiritually connected to the\n       Mist Dragon; the dragon\\&amp;#039;s death ended her life as well. The infuriated girl\n       summons a monster to attack Cecil and Kain; it causes an earthquake, which cuts\n       off the route back to Baron and knocks the three unconscious. When Cecil awakens,\n       he discovers that Kain has disappeared and the girl is injured. He carries her\n       through a desert to an inn at the oasis town of Kaipo.\n\n       READ MORE AT http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_IV#Story\n\n         INSTALLATION\n      \\&amp;#039;*~.~*\\&amp;#039;*~.~*\\&amp;#039;*~.~*\\&amp;#039;\n       1.
