Like the band's debut release, it was critically acclaimed, but the high concept and lack of &quot;radio singles&quot; contributed to lack of sales.\n\n------------------------------------\n\nWe Want Mine\n\nAnimal Skins\n\nWet Teenager\n\nMaybe I Can Fool Everybody (Tonight)\n\nRangers at Midnight\n\nVirgin...No\n\nInvaders From Mars\n\nPlay On\n\n------------------------------------\n\nThe band:\n\nJohn Palumbo ?
