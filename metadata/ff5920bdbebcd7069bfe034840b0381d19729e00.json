This is a custom remastered DVD based from extracting and recombining 4 individual CD\\&amp;#039;s.  I have put disc1, disc2, disc3, AND the docs CD\\&amp;#039;s into this 1 custom compilation because the trouble of switching the CD\\&amp;#039;s in and out has grown too darn stupid.  Therefore I put all packages and installable released material on one DVD totalling 1.7 GB and you NEVER have to switch the DVD out like the CD\\&amp;#039;s.  Which if you\\&amp;#039;ve installed FreeBSD 7.0-RELEASE non-standard install, it is absolute horror in juggling discs.\n\n\nThis is my own solution from that trouble, and I posted it here for others to also benefit from my trouble, and I will hope you keep your sanity while installing FreeBSD 7.0 from my DVD instead of 4 separate CD\\&amp;#039;s and switching them ~60 times throughout installation.\n\nI Have deemed 1 DVD much more economical, sane, and efficient, as you do not need 5 discs to install, and it is available offline if you need, compared to using the boot-only minimal CD as a single installation disc.\n\nI will also mention I did not modify the install or customize it in ANY way, it is entirely unmodified and is exactly equivalent of the official released install of 7.0.\n\nI hope you enjoy this creation, as it has saved my sanity of such a horrible installation routine ever again.  Lets hope the core FreeBSD release team releases a DVD either soon or with 7.1-RELEASE :)\n\nVerified Checksums:\n\nmd5sum = 31f0f4b864787783090c6355635e5492\n\nsha256 = d3c0f8f3f94c087dedfc1f7bff2bc6a7dbbad3569dfa1ca50e120a212ca3b078\n\n\n***********************************************************************************\n\n\nFreeBSDÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® is an advanced operating system for x86 compatible (including PentiumÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â® and AthlonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢), amd64 compatible (including OpteronÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢, AthlonÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢64, and EM64T), UltraSPARCÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, IA-64, PC-98 and ARM architectures.
