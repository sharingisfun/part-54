In one of the walls, next to tele, collage cheers to the Vista with tortured souls and figures to us agonizing.  Elsewhere, a vestibule with deformed and demonic letters leads to you to plagued infernales landscapes of horrifying monstruosidades ready to devorarte alive.  It can that as design of interiors it does not like to everybody, but at least is not the eccentricities of Agatha Ruiz of the Prada.  The apartment of that we are speaking belongs to Henry Townshend (the star of Silent Hill 4:  The Room), and the decorators are of course the doubling equipment of Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo that, once again, increases to the level of horror with the last delivery of this legendary series of terror and survival.  As we already have to you counted (he consults the section more down related Subjects), Henry discovers a day, of good to first, that its door is blocked with a pile of padlocks, and prisoner in his own house sees itself.  Giving a vueltecita by his apartment, he discovers very strange doors that they lead to other worlds in which supposedly will find the solution to the peculiar jam in which it is.  As far as the game system, ' the HabitaciÃƒÂ³n' of the title (explored from a perspective in first person, something new in the series), can be considered the center of the action, from where it is acceded to the different surroundings.  In the last turn of screens we can outdoors see at least one (a forest that is looked enough like that it appears at the beginning of SH2) and several in somewhat mugrientos interiors.  As soon as it leaves the game at the end of year, we will pass a ratito in The Room for traerte one preview with all the details.  Meanwhile, a look throws to the following gallery.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dea253b251e72fb4c6eb80bfd780105ce1eb2e46","amp;dn":"Silent+Hill+4+Usa+PS2+Full-DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dea253b251e72fb4c6eb80bfd780105ce1eb2e46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,162,83,178,81,231,47,180,198,235,128,191,215,128,16,92,225,235,46,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
