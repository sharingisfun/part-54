In addition to Palumbo and Witkowski, the original band included other former members of ArcAngel: Joey D'Amico on drums, Joe Macre on bass, and Jim Griffiths on guitar.\n\nIn 1975, the band released their critically acclaimed first album, the eponymous Crack the Sky. Although declared the &quot;debut album of the year&quot; by Rolling Stone magazine, promotion and distribution problems prevented its widespread success.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll songs written by John Palumbo\n\nHold On\nSurf City\nA Sea Epic\nShe's a Dancer\nRobots for Ronnie\nIce\nMind Baby\nI Don't Have a Tie\nSleep\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe band:\n\nJohn Palumbo ?
