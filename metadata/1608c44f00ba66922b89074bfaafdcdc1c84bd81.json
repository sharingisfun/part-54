It&amp;#039;s useful. \n\nIt has a period of evaluation of 30 days, but when the evaluation time finishes, you can still use it. The application asks you to register it, everytime you open the application. You can use serials if you really want too, but probabbly you won&amp;#039;t need it, because this version is already enough.
