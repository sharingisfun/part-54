It is also Front 242`s best release. This is claimed based upon both my personal opinion and what I believe is a widespread view. Includes the hits &amp;quot;Headhunter&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Welcome to Paradise&amp;quot;, but also the manipulative &amp;quot;Until Death&amp;quot; as well as two versions of the experimental and underestimated &amp;quot;Work 242&amp;quot;. This album is the best start to F242 and captures the essence of the true 242-feeling.
