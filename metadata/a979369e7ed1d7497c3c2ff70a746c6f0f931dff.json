How, for example, will the Black Panthers be remembered? Members of the Black Panther Party For Self Defense have been successful at turning first-person accounts into books. There was, of course, Hollywood&amp;#039;s brief, superficial flirtation with the film Panther in 1995. Last month, former panther Kathleen Cleaver was sponsor, along with filmmaker St. Claire Bourne, of a Black Panther Film Festival in New York City. It is in this tradition of Panther narrative that I place A Huey P. Newton Story, a powerful if sometimes plodding film based on Roger Guenveur Smith&amp;#039;s one-man stage play and directed by Spike Lee. (Premiering June 18 on Black Starz!) \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a979369e7ed1d7497c3c2ff70a746c6f0f931dff","amp;dn":"%28movie%29+A+Huey+P+Newton+Story.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a979369e7ed1d7497c3c2ff70a746c6f0f931dff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,121,54,158,126,209,215,73,124,60,47,247,10,116,108,111,15,147,29,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
