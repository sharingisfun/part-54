The fifth of seven LPs reissued by Orrin Keepnews and taken from Adderley&amp;#039;s Riverside years finds his band in top form on the original version of &quot;Sack O&amp;#039; Woe,&quot; a previously unissued &quot;Our Delight,&quot; Jimmy Heath&amp;#039;s &quot;Big &amp;#039;P&amp;#039;&quot; and &quot;Blue Daniel&quot; among others.
