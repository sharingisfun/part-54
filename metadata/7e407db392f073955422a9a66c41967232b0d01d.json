Though it is a simple medley of song fragments, the band came to refer to it as their &quot;mini-opera&quot;, and on the remastered CD release of their Live at Leeds album Townshend can be heard introducing it as &quot;Tommy&amp;#039;s parent&quot;. The song was performed live for The Rolling Stones&amp;#039; Rock and Roll Circus film. (The film, made in 1968, came out on video in 1995. The track can also be heard on the soundtrack of Jeff Stein&amp;#039;s film The Kids Are Alright; it is also used in Wes Anderson&amp;#039;s film Rushmore, but the soundtrack album uses the Live at Leeds version.)\n\n\n\nThis video is the live performance by The Who from The Rolling Stones&amp;#039; Rock and Roll Circus Film.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e407db392f073955422a9a66c41967232b0d01d","amp;dn":"The+Who+-+A+Quick+One+While+He%5C%27s+Away","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e407db392f073955422a9a66c41967232b0d01d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,64,125,179,146,240,115,149,84,34,169,166,108,65,150,114,50,176,208,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
