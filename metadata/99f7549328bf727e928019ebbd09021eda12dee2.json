You can create \nextremely high detailed models, as in several millions of \npolygons. If you use a pen and tablet youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll find painting \nand sculpting detail and textures onto your object much \neasier than using a mouse and much more natural feeling. \nAnd if you like to paint 2D scenes with rich textures and \nvibrant colors, it can do that, too! ZBrush has a unique \nbuilding block called Pixols, which are similar to pixels \nexcept they also contain depth, orientation and material.\n\nZBrush from Pixologic has been around for a few years \nnow, but it remains a remarkable graphics program that \nreally has no equal Ã¢â‚¬â€œ or even poor copy, for that matter. \nVersion 2 introduces more 3D tools and features to the \nalready impressive set, making the tool evenly split \nbetween a 2.5D painting program and full 3D modelling \napplication. In working practice though, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s both, because \nmany of the workflows in ZBrush make use of the 2.5D \ncanvas and the polygon models.\n\nZBrush uses a unique deep-pixel technology called \nPixols, which can be painted at depth as well as on the \n2D plane. Pixols can mount up on top of existing Pixols, \nenabling you to almost Ã¢â‚¬ËœpourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ them on the screen. \nAlternatively, they can be applied negatively to cut into \nan existing image. You can add primitive (and not so \nprimitive) 3D objects to the image, rotate and move them, \nand they will interact smoothly with the Z-depth of the \ncanvas, with the Pixols intersecting the canvas at different \ndepths.\n\nInstallation Instructions:\nUnrar\nInstall the app (setup.exe)\nSelect install via telephone.  It will give you a reqest code.\nEnter the request code into the keygen.\nEnter the response code (from KG) to reg the prog!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nKeygen by Paradox","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99f7549328bf727e928019ebbd09021eda12dee2","amp;dn":"ZBrush+2+The+newest+release%21%21%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99f7549328bf727e928019ebbd09021eda12dee2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,247,84,147,40,191,114,126,146,128,25,235,189,9,2,30,218,18,222,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
