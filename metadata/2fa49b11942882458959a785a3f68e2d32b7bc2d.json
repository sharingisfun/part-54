Started as a bombing range in 1933, the base became an important bomber training base during World War II. Since the Air Force Test Center was first established, Edwards Air Force Base has seen more flight records broken than any other base throughout history. THUNDER IN THE DESERT explores the history of the base by offering the insights of people who actually worked there. General Chuck Yeager and fellow expert aviators also examine and profile some of the most extraordinary aircrafts and flight programs to pass through the Air Force Test Center, including the B-2 bomber, Space Shuttle, x-15 program, X-1 Supersonic, airborne laser, F-15 Trail slide, FA-22 Raptor.\n\nWatch The Military Channel - Go Behind The Lines\n\n4n00bis","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2fa49b11942882458959a785a3f68e2d32b7bc2d","amp;dn":"Thunder+In+The+Desert+-+Edwards+AFB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2fa49b11942882458959a785a3f68e2d32b7bc2d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,164,155,17,148,40,130,69,137,89,167,133,163,246,142,45,50,183,188,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
