How important an attractive interface is can be seen on the basis of Windows XP and how the entire system feels at once fresher and more modern.\n\nBut just as in fashion, it&amp;#039;s easy to get tired of the new design, not to mention the people who have always been bothered by what they consider a &quot;candy&quot; look. Wouldn&amp;#039;t it be practical to be able to change the appearance of Windows?\n\nTake the icons for example. These little square pictures are everywhere, in the Start menu, in file dialogs and of course on the desktop. Is there a way to lend all of these icons a new look with a few mouse clicks?\n\n\nAnd what about the logon screen? Anyone who shares their computer with others or has a password to protect his user account sees it every day: a mixture of different blue tones. And there is no way built into Windows to change this.
