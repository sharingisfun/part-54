Dr. Jack Mason en route to assess threat levels. Request cryogenic containment of infected subject 'B': Karina J. All prisoner rights are hereby revoked under Section-4 of the Transgenic Containment Act. Evacuate non-essential personnel in preparation for possible thermonuclear containment protocol.\n\n\nFrom the creators of UnrealÃ‚Â® comes a spiraling plunge into destruction, despair and disease. Jack Mason is a burned-out doctor with no will to live, that is, until he nearly dies in a transport crash. Now he and his infected patient are stranded deep within the most vicious prison sectors of a wasteland called 'Earth'. In sixteen hours an orbital platform will initiate a total biohazard containment procedure: 50-megaton yield, detonated above sea level, to cleanse the contamination.\n\n\nKnown for creating games with incredibly rich dynamic graphics and mind-blowing fine-tuned gameplay, including the recent smash hit Unreal Tournament 2004, Digital Extremes is reaching beyond the limits with its most ambitious project to date. Pariah is utilizing the power of a heavily modified Unreal engine with state-of-the-art Havok physics technology that produces stunning settings, lifelike characters and tremendously satisfying in-your-face first-person action.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a9fca616c9d244c501cd41e0f7343b26b97b2b8","amp;dn":"Pariah+XBOX+PAL-SLT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a9fca616c9d244c501cd41e0f7343b26b97b2b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,159,202,97,108,157,36,76,80,28,212,30,15,115,67,178,107,151,178,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
