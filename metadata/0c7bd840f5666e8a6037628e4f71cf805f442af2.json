It&amp;#039;s also notable for the &quot;festival&quot; atmosphere, with recitations from Michael Moorcock &amp; Robert Calvert, and a great 14-minute instrumental jam.  The only sad thing is that it&amp;#039;s clearly incomplete, since it cuts off in the middle of The Watcher (and they would have certainly played Master of the Universe next, perhaps after another poem).\n\nUnfortunately, the transfer is somewhat flawed, with some odd (infrequent) level changes and some clipping (although not severely), but is still very listenable.  There are a few short gaps at the start/end of some tracks (perhaps the taper turned the recorder off), but little music seems to be missing.  Orgone Accumulator is clearly spliced in from an inferior source, but the (relatively) high sound quality is maintained for the remaining tracks.  Most of the track indices were way off, so it was extracted as a single wav, then split with a new cue sheet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c7bd840f5666e8a6037628e4f71cf805f442af2","amp;dn":"Hawkwind+1973-08-29+Windsor+Festival","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c7bd840f5666e8a6037628e4f71cf805f442af2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,123,216,64,245,102,110,138,96,55,98,142,79,113,207,128,95,68,42,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
