Snapz Pro X 2.x costs $69. Upgrades from Snapz Pro X 1.x w/ movie capture are $20.\n\nWhy take a static screenshot when Snapz Pro X makes creating a movie just as easy? Snapz Pro X does that, and so much more! Download a free demo version right now, or check out the demo movies we&amp;#039;ve created and see for yourself.\n\nSnapz Pro X is a quantum leap in video capture technology, adroitly capturing full motion video of anything on your screen at a blistering pace, complete with digital audio, and an optional microphone voiceover. Think of it as a digital video camera for your screen. Snapz Pro X makes short work of making training videos, producing product demos, creating tutorials, archiving streaming video, and anything else you can think of.\n\nFind out why companies like Apple Inc., Adobe Systems Inc., and countless others rely on Snapz Pro X when they need to convey an idea effectively. Find out why average users are taking full motion video screen captures rather than the static screenshots of old. Join the video capture revolution!\n\nIn addition to a video capture engine that is 20 times faster than anything else on the market, Snapz Pro X has so many other new features, you&amp;#039;ll quickly wonder how you ever lived without it. We didn&amp;#039;t follow the industry trend of bloated software with extraneous features; instead we rethought the product.\n\nSnapz Pro X&amp;#039;s interface has been completely redesigned to provide more powerful features while maintaining the Snapz Pro X&amp;#039;s elegant simplicity. Rather than just tossing new features into an already full-featured product, we carefully examined how people use Snapz Pro X, and developed a new user interface that adds functionality without adding complexity.\n\nFor those who need static screen captures for manuals, web sites, etc., Snapz Pro X offers many improvements. One of the most useful is &quot;Live Preview&quot; which shows you exactly how your screenshot will look before you save it to disk. This allows you to change border styles, scaling, cropping, and other settings on the fly. No longer will you have to guess what your screenshots will look like - now you can get them right the very first time.\n\nSnapz Pro X supports saving screenshots as .bmp, .pict, .gif, .jpg, .png, .tiff, .pdf, or Photoshop files with precise control over image compression. Screenshots can be scaled, cropped, color depth-changed, and dithered. Snapz Pro X can also add borders, generate automatic thumbnails, overlay watermarks/copyright notices... you name it, we got it!\t\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.ambrosiasw.com/utilities/snapzprox/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n--------------------\n\nAfter mounting the .dmg file, license is included as the SN# file.
