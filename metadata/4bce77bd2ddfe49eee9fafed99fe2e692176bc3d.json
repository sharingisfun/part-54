The band was formed in the spring of 1965 by four brothers ÃƒÂ¢?? Barry, Bill, Bob, and John Cowsill. After their initial success, the brothers were later joined by their siblings, Susan and Paul and their mother, Barbara. Rounding out the group was remaining brother Richard, who did not sing with the group, but was assigned as road manager and advisor.\n\nIn 1968, the band scored another million selling hit with the song Indian Lake which reached #10 on the charts and in 1969, the band had another number two hit and another million seller with their version of the title song from the musical Hair.\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bce77bd2ddfe49eee9fafed99fe2e692176bc3d","amp;dn":"The+Cowsills+-+Hair+%28Live%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bce77bd2ddfe49eee9fafed99fe2e692176bc3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,206,119,189,45,223,228,158,238,159,175,237,153,254,46,105,33,118,188,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
