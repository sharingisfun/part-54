Martin lives in the world\\&amp;#039;s southernmost city, Ushaia. His father is an anthropologist, last reported as working in Brazil. Leaving behind his mother and stepfather, the boy travels north, encountering scenes of exploitation and destruction, abject subjugation to the U.S.A., and of high absurdity. An example of the latter would be when a national president whose surname means \\&quot;frog\\&quot; puts on rubber flippers in order to survey the damage in a flooded city. Along the way, he also learns about environmental and cultural destruction, particularly in reference to indigenous cultures and peoples. His astonishing journeys take him as far as Mexico. This meandering tale was profoundly popular in Latin America.
