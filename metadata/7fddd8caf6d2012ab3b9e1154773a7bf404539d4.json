It is estimated  that our  eye can\nsee  over  a dynamic  range of  nearly 24\nf-stops  while  a   digital  camera   can\ncapture  a  dynamic range  around 6  to 9\nf-stops.\n\nFor this scene we  could set  our digital\ncamera to correctly capture\nthe sky or the  foreground, but  not both\nat same time\n\nThe High Dynamic Range  Imaging is  a set\nof  techniques  that  has  been developed\nnearly  20  years  ago  to  overcome  the\nlimitations  of  electronic  devices   by\ncombining  multiple  exposures  into  one\ngreat looking image.\n\nUsing  HDR technique  we can  combine the\ndifferent  exposures  to create  a single\nimage\nthat shows  details in  both sky  and the\nland.\n\nA  HDR  photography  can  be  created  by\ntaking   few   photos    with   different\nexposure,  then  combining  them  in  the\nsoftware  into a  high dynamic  file. The\nlast thing is to  tone-map the  HDR image\nso we can see it in our screen, print it,\npost it on the web and enjoy.\n\nWe  created  our  software  to  be   very\nenjoyable, fast and straight  forward. No\nfiddling      with       incomprehensible\nparameters.  And  as  it  is  common  for\nMediachance products  we added  many cool\nnew inventions that you may not have seen\nyet in any other package.\n\nEasy  to  understand software  with super\nfast preview\n\nPowerful    Auto-Aligning,    Manual   or\nAuto-Assist  Aligning  of images  with an\ninnovative Pin  Warping that  can correct\nall  types  of  misalignment,   including\ncamera roll, pitch or yaw\nAnti-ghosting  mask  that  can completely\neliminate ghosting of moving objects\n\nVarious tone mapping procedures  that can\ncreate  a  whole range  of images  - from\nsmooth photographic tone mapping  to very\ndramatic images\n\nLoad and save HDR files\n\nWorks with most RAW camera formats\nSupport for 360 Panoramic images\nBatch Processing to  add images  to queue\nand then process them all at once\nLive  HDR  preview during  various steps,\nyou can see tonemapped image preview even\nbefore you create HDR\n\nLive  HDR  preview  instantly  shows  the\ntone-mapped result\neven before you create HDR file.\n\nDynamic  Photo HDR  has already  few very\ninteresting  build-in  filters  for Orton\nEffect  or  to  create  eye-catching  B/W\nphotos.\nYou can use new  Pseudo-HDR process  on a\nsingle 8-bit source\n\nNew Pseudo HDR process can convincingly\ncreate HDR tone mapping on a single 8-bit\nsource.\n\nOur  new real-time  Light Tuner  will let\nyou change the Tone-Mapped effect and see\nthe  feedback  result immediately  as you\nmove   the   Light   Orb,   without   any\ncalculation\n\nYou can create fine-tuned Black and White\nshots with the B/W channel Mixer\nMore  cool  effects  such as  Vignette or\nMysterious light.\nColor Correction using  Kelvin parameters\nwith preview table.\nMatch Color will allow you to  match your\nnew tonemapped image  to any  other photo\nor painting.\n\nMatch  Color  can  match  your  image  to\nanother image colors.\nHere  shown  also  with  Mysterious Light\nColor Filter.\n\nPin Warping\nAligning image taken by  hand is  not any\nbig problem in  our software.  The unique\nPin  Warping method  can align  even most\nstubborn  images  where  camera  shifted,\nchanged roll, pitch or yaw.\n\nAnti-Ghosting Mask\nIf an object moved while you  were taking\ndifferent  shots,  this  would   normally\ncreate a &quot;ghost&quot; on the final image.\nWe added  a powerful  yet very  simple to\nuse  anti-ghosting  mask  feature.   Just\npaint  over  all  instances of  the moved\nobjects (you don&amp;#039;t even  have to  be very\nprecise)  and  it  will  without   trace\ncompletely eliminate the ghosts  from the\nfinal image. In Full version you  can use\nLive  HDR  function.  Just  press   Quick\nPreview button that will almost instantly\nshow you  the result  HDR image  with the\nanti-ghosting mask applied.\n\nOnce  a  moved  objects  are  marked, the\nAnti-Ghosting process will automatically\nelliminate the ghosts  and keep  only one\ninstance of the object.\n\nVersion     3    (16/APR/2008):     Batch\nProcessing, Light-Tuner, B/W  Mixer, Fine\npreview, Noise Reduction.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mediachance.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mediachance.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\ni N S T A L L   N O T E S\n\n1) Unpack\n2) Install\n3) Enjoy\n\nN E W S  &amp;  C O N T A C T\n\nAfter so many years in the scene, both as\nindividuals   and   as   a  group   we&amp;#039;ve\ndefinately  become  more  refined,   with\nkeygens  and retail  supplies and  not to\nmention the  latest addition,  ebooks.
