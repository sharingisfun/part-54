This opening volume of an ongoing series comes up with 28 terrific performances illustrating that the corporate giant at least had their pulse on what actually constituted rhythm &amp; blues in the early 1950s, and then some. From the out-and-out wildness of Mr. Bear and the Bearcats&amp;#039; &quot;Mr. Bear Comes to Town,&quot; Big Al Sears&amp;#039; &quot;Great Googa Mooga,&quot; Milt Trenier&amp;#039;s &quot;Day Old Bread&quot; and the Jackson Brothers&amp;#039; &quot;There&amp;#039;s No Other Way,&quot; this collection also plumbs some deep blues with the unissued Larry Dale tracks &quot;Midnight Hours,&quot; &quot;Please Tell Me&quot; and &quot;Down to the Bottom,&quot; all three featuring some stellar guitar work from Mickey Baker. Other highlights include Louis Jordan&amp;#039;s &quot;Chicken Back,&quot; Big Al Sears&amp;#039; &quot;Rock&amp;#039;n&amp;#039;Roll Ball,&quot; Beatrice Reading&amp;#039;s bluesy &quot;I&quot;ll Do It All Again,&quot; an 11-year-old George Benson&amp;#039;s first record (&quot;She Makes Me Mad&quot;), Eartha Kitt&amp;#039;s uncharacteristic R&amp;B outing &quot;My Heart&amp;#039;s Delight,&quot; and Big Connie&amp;#039;s &quot;Mumbles Blues.&quot; A nice chunk of seldom-anthologized American music. ~ Cub Koda, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ebe17c9d4e9bd631d2b0f2695ce3c7c8a6069cf","amp;dn":"Honkin%5C%27+%5C%27N%5C%27+Hollerin%5C%27-+R%26B+from+the+Radio+Corporation%2C+Vol.+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ebe17c9d4e9bd631d2b0f2695ce3c7c8a6069cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,190,23,201,212,233,189,99,29,43,15,38,149,206,60,124,138,96,105,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
