The website serves to host testimonial on-record interviews with whistle blowers revealing insider information about classified projects, UFO/alien contact and earth changes.\n\nAll video interviews are available individually from www.projectcamelot.org and Google Video. This torrent contains ALL of the MOV &amp; MP4 format interviews from May 2006 to May 2008, including extra material such as audio messages from Leo Zagami, The Gore Report recording, and the theme song \\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;Jaguar\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&quot;. These files can be played with Quicktime Player or VNC. This torrent was created because the MOV/MP4 files are higher quality than the WMV files of other torrents.\n\nThe information discussed in these interviews is not for the faint hearted or closed minded. At the very least, treat this as great sci-fi.\n\nRejoice in the love and light, and go forth in the power of the one Creator.\nEnjoy!\n\n\nCONTENTS (in date order):\n\n- David Wilcock Extras\n    Divine Cosmos - The Revealing III - The Mars Bloodline.html\n    The_Cutting_Edge_The_Gore_Report.htm\n    The_Gore_Report.mp3\n    030404_10_gorereport.wma\n- extras\n    Project Camelot | Interview with Henry Deacon.html\n    leo_zagami_cellphone_short.mp3\n    leo_zagami_cellphone_long.mp3\n    Jaguar.mp3\n\nProject Camelot Interviews.html\n\nJim Sparks and Bill Holden.mov\nJohn Lear Tells All Part 1.mov\nJohn Lear Tells All Part 2.mov\nJohn Lear Tells All Part 3.mov\nJohn Lear Tells All Part 4.mov\nGeorge Green Part 1.mov\nGeorge Green Part 2.mov\n***bonus: George Green Magnetic Motor.mp4\nDavid Wilcock (Futuretalk).mov\nLeo Zagami Part 1.mov\nLeo Zagami Part 2.mov\nLeo Zagami Part 3.mov\nLuca Scantamburlo Part 1.mov\nLuca Scantamburlo Part 2.mov\nBenjamin Fulford Part 1.mov\nBenjamin Fulford Part 2.mov\nBenjamin Fulford Part 3.mov\nBoriska.mov\nRichard Hoagland Part 1.mov\nRichard Hoagland Part 2.mov\nRichard Hoagland Part 3.mov\nDavid Wilcock (Jumproom to Mars).mov\nDan Sherman.mp4\nBob Dean Part 1.mov\nBob Dean Part 2.mov\nBob Dean Part 3 (with Marcia Schafer).mov\nBill Holden.mov\nJim Sparks.mov\nDan Burisch (Stargate Secrets) Part 1.mov\nDan Burisch (Stargate Secrets) Part 2.mov\nDavid Wilcock Part 1.mov\nDavid Wilcock Part 2.mov\nDavid Wilcock Part 3.mov\nDavid Wilcock Part 4.mov\nDuncan O\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;Finioan and David Corso.mov\nSgt.
