His choice to confront their decision leads into a downward spiral of physical and emotional events that reinvigorates a new creativity within his production. \n\nThe self-awareness and maturity that emerges from this helps strengthen relationships within the film and symbolises the introspective journey undertaken by an individual. \n\nIt is a story of a man alone, fighting his internal demons and external limitations. It deals with the common misconceptions surrounding the nature of mental illness and their impact on the life of a sufferer.\n\nPlease enjoy.\n\nwww.filmic.co.nz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ad0938d0cbe37a6e125222e4b7c1424302c6d4c","amp;dn":"A+Very+Interesting+Short+Film","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ad0938d0cbe37a6e125222e4b7c1424302c6d4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,208,147,141,12,190,55,166,225,37,34,46,75,124,20,36,48,44,109,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
