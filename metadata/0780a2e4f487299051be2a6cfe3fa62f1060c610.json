A mysterious French work is brought to her for interpretation at the Thai consulate in Paris. She realizes the document is Voyageur, written by French naturalist Francois Xavier about Siam in the mid 19th century. Maneejan is moved by the record?s allusions to Siam?s shadowy past. When she returns to Thailand, she finds herself in a half-dream state, witnessing and experiencing her home country as it was more than a century ago, Siam as it struggled to defy outside influences to become a new civilization. Maneejan learns much about her country?s history, becomes a fighter alongside her cultural ancestors, and finds valuable lessons in life and love along the way.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0780a2e4f487299051be2a6cfe3fa62f1060c610","amp;dn":"Thai+Movie+-+Thawipob+aka+The+Siam+Renaissance","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0780a2e4f487299051be2a6cfe3fa62f1060c610","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,128,162,228,244,135,41,144,81,190,42,108,254,63,166,47,16,96,198,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
