One desperate mission. Savage, a former navy SEAL and American state-of-the-art security specialist. Akira, Japan&amp;#039;s most brilliant executive protector and a master of the samurai arts.\n\nTheir mission: the retrieval of Rachel Stone, a beautiful American woman whose ruthless billionaire husband is out to destroy her. But quickly, Savage and Akira realize that they are trapped in a mission more far-reaching than the protection of one person. For they are bound together in a common nightmare, a set of horrifying memories, a terrifying past that never happened, but is somehow inexplicably real. Only together can they confront the mystery. Yet when they do, an even more chilling scenario awaits themÃƒÂ¢??one with power to shatter not only their world but ours as well.
