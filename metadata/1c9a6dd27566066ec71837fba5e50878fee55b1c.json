This new release contains a host of upgrades in comparison with the previous version. Kaspersky Anti-Hacker is a personal firewall designed to protect computers running under Windows from unsanctioned access and hacker attacks. The firewall monitors all network operations, application activity, packet filtration of incoming and outgoing data. Confidential data is secure. The new version retained the features that made version 1.5 so popular: an ergonomic user interface and ease-of-use, especially for novice users. Installation is simple and a 5 point scale provides users with an easy way to configure protection. Kaspersky Anti-Hacker still works in stealth mode, where the local machine blocks all external network requests: the user can surf the Internet, invisible and secure. New features include compatibility MS SP2, something Windows XP users are sure to appreciate. Kaspersky Lab developers have analyzed user feedback and modified the product in accordance with user comments, eliminating features that users asked to have removed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9a6dd27566066ec71837fba5e50878fee55b1c","amp;dn":"Kaspersky+Anti-Hacker+v1.7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9a6dd27566066ec71837fba5e50878fee55b1c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,154,109,210,117,102,6,110,199,24,55,251,165,229,8,120,254,229,91,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
