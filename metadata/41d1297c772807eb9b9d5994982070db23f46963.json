Trouble strikes again when he is discovered leaving a deserving few dead in the process. He returns back to America to once again make contact with now disgraced Agent Clarice Starling who is suffering the wrath of a malicious FBI official/rival as well as the media. Meanwhile, Hannibal must survive the advances by a disfigured and vengeful victim he first came in contact with years ago as a patient. He finds himself being tracked down not only by his wealthy victim and his henchmen but also by Agent Starling and the American authorities.  -IMDB. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41d1297c772807eb9b9d5994982070db23f46963","amp;dn":"Hannibal.2001.DVDRip.Xvid.%5BMan0war777%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41d1297c772807eb9b9d5994982070db23f46963","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,209,41,124,119,40,7,235,155,157,89,148,152,32,112,219,35,244,105,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
