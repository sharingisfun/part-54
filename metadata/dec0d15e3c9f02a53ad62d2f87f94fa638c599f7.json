It was released as a single in 1988 and went to Number 3 in the US (their third US Top Ten hit).\n\nThe actual line of &quot;Armageddon It&quot; is meant to be a word play on the line &quot;I&amp;#039;m A Gettin&amp;#039; It&quot;, thought up by the band during the recording sessions for the Hysteria album. The vocal style of the song is described as &quot;Eddie Cochran meets T.Rex&quot;, according to singer Joe Elliott.\n\nThe video for the song was the second to feature Def Leppard in a live arena setting. On February 12 &amp; 13 1988, the band recorded two shows at the McNichols Arena in Denver, Colorado for a future live film release. However, a month later, &quot;Armageddon It&quot; was set to be released as the fourth single off the popular &quot;Hysteria&quot; album and a promo video clip was urgently needed.\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dec0d15e3c9f02a53ad62d2f87f94fa638c599f7","amp;dn":"Def+Leppard+-+Armageddon+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dec0d15e3c9f02a53ad62d2f87f94fa638c599f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,192,209,94,60,159,2,165,58,214,45,47,135,249,79,166,56,197,153,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
