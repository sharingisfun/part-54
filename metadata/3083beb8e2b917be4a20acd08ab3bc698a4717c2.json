Home to one of the largest coral reef systems in the world -- nearly as vast as Australia&amp;#039;s Great Barrier Reef - the NWHI archipelago composed of 10 islands and more than 100 reefs and shoals.\n\nThey create a rich tropical marine environment and form the foundation of an ecosystem that hosts more than 7,000 species, including marine mammals, fishes, sea turtles, birds and invertebrates. Many are rare, threatened or endangered. At least a quarter of them can be found nowhere else on Earth. They are protected by America&amp;#039;s largest National Wildlife Refuge, open only to scientists.\n\n\nRelated Documentaries\n\n* The Abyss\n* Coral Reef Adventure\n* Jacques Cousteau Odyssey\n* Deep Blue\n* Ocean Oasis\n* Eye on the Reef\n* Ocean Empires\n* Jewels of the Caribbean Sea\n* Coral Sea Dreaming\n* Watery Creatures and Rocky Shores\n* Blue Planet (BBC)\n* Blue Realm: Underwater Adventure\n* Into the Deep\n* The Deep\n* Australia&amp;#039;s Marine World\n* Ocean Odyssey\n* Ocean Drifters\n* Secrets of the Great Barrier Reef\n* Australia&amp;#039;s Great Barrier Reef\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n\nVideo Codec: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate: 4203 KB/s\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nVideo Resolution: 1280 x 720\nAudio Codec: untouched FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3)\nAudio BitRate: 448 KB/s (CBR)\nAudio Channels: 2 Ch\nRunTime: 00:45\nFramerate: 25 FPS\nNumber Of Parts: 2\nPart Size: 1.45 GB ea\nEncoded by: gavin63\nSubtitles: No TV Cap\nSource: HDTV\n\nwww mvgroup org avi","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3083beb8e2b917be4a20acd08ab3bc698a4717c2","amp;dn":"PBS+Ocean+Adventures+Voyage+to+Kure+1of2+720p+Xvid+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3083beb8e2b917be4a20acd08ab3bc698a4717c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,131,190,184,226,185,23,190,74,32,172,208,138,179,188,105,138,71,23,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
