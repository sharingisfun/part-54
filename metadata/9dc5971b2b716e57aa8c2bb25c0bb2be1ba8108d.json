And now - you. \n    \n    Close Combat: First to Fight represents modern urban combat with unprecedented \n    authenticity. It is a first-person shooter in which you lead a four-man fire team \n    of United States Marines through the perils of urban combat in the Middle East. \n\n    At every step in Close Combat: First to FightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development, active-duty Marines, \n    fresh from firefights in the Middle East, were there to tell us exactly how they \n    do it: How they move.How they talk. The tactics they employ. What it sounds like \n    to be in a firefight and much more! \n\n    The result is a game so real that Close Combat: First to Fight will be used as a \n    training tool by the Marines themselves. Close Combat: First to Fight is as close \n    as you can get on a computer or Xbox to being a Marine fireteam leader in modern \n    urban combat.\n\n    Features: First to Fight is the only first-person shooter that:\n\n    * was developed with the close involvement of active-duty US Marines fresh from \n    combat in the Middle East. \n\n    * uses authentic Marine urban military doctrine (Ready-Team-Fire-Assist) which \n    governs how Marines manoeuvre through urban environments. \n\n    * uses the Marine Air Ground Task Force (MAGTF) to destroy enemies: call for fire \n    and support from Cobra helicopters, mortar, other fireteams, tanks and AAVs. \n\n    *allows players to use true-to-life urban military tactics and strategies to defeat \n    enemies: lay suppressing fire, flank enemies, separate leaders from enemies, etc. \n\n    *uses a psychology model that makes the AI behave and react to situations as real \n    people would.  \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dc5971b2b716e57aa8c2bb25c0bb2be1ba8108d","amp;dn":"Close+Combat+First+to+Fight-HOODLUM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dc5971b2b716e57aa8c2bb25c0bb2be1ba8108d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,197,151,27,43,113,110,87,170,140,43,178,92,11,178,190,27,168,16,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
