There is no narration, but the filmmaker gives a point to the presentation through his use of film techniques and soundtrack. In order to get this sort of access, Mr. Fleury did have to make concessions to the DPRK government, and its clear that they are putting their best face forward here. However, there is a jarring dissonance between what they must think is their &quot;best face&quot; and what international viewers will probably see as a grim, claustrophobic, and stultifying life that can only be endured by projecting all life&amp;#039;s miseries on the &quot;bastard Americans&quot;. Best watched in conjunction with &quot;A State of Mind&quot;.\n\nLike this film? http://thepiratebay.se/user/milomaddock for other related films.\n\nSEED UNTIL YOU BLEED!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cfc7e772e754240cb1ec5a5bfac1eab956b01ae9","amp;dn":"North+Korea%3A+A+Day+in+the+Life+%282004%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cfc7e772e754240cb1ec5a5bfac1eab956b01ae9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,199,231,114,231,84,36,12,177,236,90,91,250,193,234,185,86,176,26,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
