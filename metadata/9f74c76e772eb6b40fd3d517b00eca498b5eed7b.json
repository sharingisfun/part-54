Elsa cares for her charges, but tolerates no stepping out of line. But now, as she approaches 50, cracks begin to appear in Elsa\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s professionalism. As her grown daughter prepares to leave home, and her marriage becomes more and more strained, Elsa longs for the intensity of experiencing something outside of her routine, something outside the norm. \n\nYoung, obsessed, Jan eagerly fills this void, offering to sexually subjugate himself to her. And Elsa enters willingly into this risky venture, desiring the verboten, but knowing it cannot end well. \n\nWinner of the Golden Leopard prize at the 2006 Locarno Film Festival, PUNISH ME features engaging performances from Kostja Ullmann, one of the standout, lead actors in the theatrical release SUMMER STORM and from Maren Kroymann, a distinguished lesbian actress from Germany. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f74c76e772eb6b40fd3d517b00eca498b5eed7b","amp;dn":"Punish+Me+%28Verfolgt%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f74c76e772eb6b40fd3d517b00eca498b5eed7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,116,199,110,119,46,182,180,15,211,213,23,176,14,202,73,139,94,237,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
