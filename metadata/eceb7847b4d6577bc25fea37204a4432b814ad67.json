It is directed by Denzel Washington who also stars in the film along with Forest Whitaker[1], Kimberly Elise, Denzel Whitaker[2], Nate Parker [3], Gina Ravera, and Jurnee Smollett. The screenplay was written by Suzan-Lori Parks and Robert Eisele.[4] It was released on December 25, 2007.\n\nThe film, based on a true story, revolves around the efforts of debate coach Melvin B. Tolson (Denzel Washington) at historically black Wiley College to place his team on equal footing with whites in the American south during the 1930s, when lynch mobs and Jim Crow laws abounded. The Wiley team eventually succeeds to the point at which they are able to take part in a debate with Harvard University.\n\nRipped by Aminos MY","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eceb7847b4d6577bc25fea37204a4432b814ad67","amp;dn":"The+Great+Debaters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eceb7847b4d6577bc25fea37204a4432b814ad67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,235,120,71,180,214,87,123,194,95,234,55,32,74,68,50,184,20,173,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
