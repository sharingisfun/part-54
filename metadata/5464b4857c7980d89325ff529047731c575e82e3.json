It catalogs your CDs, OGG, WMA, MPC, FLAC, APE, WAV and MP3 audio files.

It includes a CD ripper, CD/DVD Burner, and audio converter for saving music, and manual or automated playlist editors for creating music mixes. Its player automatically adjusts volume levels so that you don&amp;#039;t have continually fiddle with the volume control and supports hundreds of Winamp plug-ins and visualizations; or if you prefer, it can use Winamp as the default player. It also includes portable audio device synchronization that allows you to quickly synch tracks and playlists with iPods, MP3 Phones, and other portable audio devices.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5464b4857c7980d89325ff529047731c575e82e3","amp;dn":"MediaMonkey+Standard+3.0.2.1134","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5464b4857c7980d89325ff529047731c575e82e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,100,180,133,124,121,128,216,147,37,255,82,144,71,115,28,87,94,130,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
