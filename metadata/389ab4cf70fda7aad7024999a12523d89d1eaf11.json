The residents interviewed tell story&amp;#039;s of a violent police force, lack of outreach from Red Cross, gentrification, an apathetic government and a poorly organized FEMA. To overcome these hurdles, a group of collectives dubbed, &quot;Common Ground&quot; forms to provide immediate and free shelter, food, legal assistance and a medical clinic. This documentary challenges the viewer to see the social injustice and lack of government effectiveness in modern day America and offers an age-old example to remedy the problem.
