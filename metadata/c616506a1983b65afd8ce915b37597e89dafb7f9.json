The CD contains 9 exclusive club tracks.\n\nThe CD starts off with an electro remix of the old BLT and Danni Makov hit - Patterns of from A Balter, then a new monster big tune from Maelstrom there for sure will make the dance floor euphoric. Next is Peter Gun and Terzi, this time with a big hitter called &amp;#039;Acapulco&amp;#039;. This tune was for long no. 2 on the chart of release records promo pool.\n\nNyquist again deliver with a new fat club tune, and we can with joy look forward to the Nyquist album later in the year. A long awaited new tune from Behind Blue Eyes is also present. This time in co-operation with Swedish Krusseldorf. Next up is C-Jay from Amsterdam, here with a Jaydee remix. At last Elegant Universe is back with a new monster big track on Iboga Records and afterwards is the Ticon duo, from Sweden, with their club project Ndsa. As the conclusion track we find the new Iboga artists, Quantize from Israel. This is the only fast tune on the CD, but it is certainly a big track. Quantize will release their debut album on Iboga in the time to come..\n\nStyle: Progress Trance\n\nReleased: Feb. 2008/08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c616506a1983b65afd8ce915b37597e89dafb7f9","amp;dn":"Set8+-+Electronic+Ballroom+-+2008+-+iboga+records","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c616506a1983b65afd8ce915b37597e89dafb7f9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,22,80,106,25,131,182,90,253,140,233,21,179,117,151,232,157,175,183,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
