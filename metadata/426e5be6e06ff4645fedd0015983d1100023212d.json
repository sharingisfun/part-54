Despite the recent departures of Chris Hillman and Gram Parsons for the Flying Burrito Brothers, the sound and repertoire are still very much in the Byrds' country-rock phase, many of the 16 tracks coming from the Sweetheart of the Rodeo and Dr. Byrds &amp;amp; Mr. Hyde albums. The big mid-'60s hits are revisited in a medley, and a few other songs first recorded in the pre-White days -- &amp;quot;So You Want to Be a Rock 'n' Roll Star&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Chimes of Freedom&amp;quot; among them -- also show up. There are also covers of Merle Haggard and Buck Owens tunes that would not show up on Byrds albums. It's a pleasant, but not outstanding, set, probably of most interest to those who enjoy White's guitar playing. He and McGuinn work pretty well together here, but the timing of the band as a whole is sometimes tenuous, and the vocal harmonies are not as full as those of other Byrds configurations. ~ Richie Unterberger, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:426e5be6e06ff4645fedd0015983d1100023212d","amp;dn":"The+Byrds+-+Live+At+The+Fillmore+West+February+1969+%40+256+%2B+cove","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"426e5be6e06ff4645fedd0015983d1100023212d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,110,91,230,224,111,244,100,95,237,208,1,89,131,209,16,0,35,33,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
