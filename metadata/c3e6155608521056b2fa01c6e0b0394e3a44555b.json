His singles \\&quot;The Maritimes\\&quot;, \\&quot;5th Element\\&quot; and \\&quot;No Mistakes\\&quot; were all Top 20 hits on MuchMusic and MTV Canada that year. His video for \\&quot;No Mistakes\\&quot; won an MMVA for MuchVibe Best Rap Video. His eleventh album, Hitch Hikin\\&amp;#039; Music, was released on September 19, 2006.\n\nClassified attended Hants East Rural High School in Milford, Nova Scotia. After two years of perfecting his craft and sorting through label contracts, Classified produced, recorded and released his ninth album, Trial &amp; Error, and signed a nationwide distribution deal with Toronto-based, URBNET Records. Containing collaborations with up-and-coming Canadian artists like Eternia and DL Incognito, as well as Canadian rap veteran, Maestro, the album was one of the highest selling independent rap albums in Canada in 2004.\n\nIn addition to the release of Trial &amp; Error, 2003 and 2004 were busy and evolutionary years for Classified. With the continuous support of VideoFACT, he was able to release two additional music videos for the singles \\&quot;Just the Way It Is\\&quot; and \\&quot;Unexpected\\&quot;. Classified also continued to master his production skills and joined forces with some of Canada\\&amp;#039;s most prominent emcees, including Choclair and Maestro Fresh Wes. He also teamed up with former Columbia Records recording artist, Royce Da 5\\&amp;#039;9\\&quot; and opened for Ludacris, Busta Rhymes, The Game and Black Moon.\n\nClassified\\&amp;#039;s tenth album, Boy-Cott-In the Industry, was a high point in his career. The album includes guest appearances by Choclair, Royce Da 5\\&amp;#039;9\\&quot;, Jay Bizzy, J-Bru, Spesh K, and Mic Boyd (Classified\\&amp;#039;s younger brother and fellow MC).\n\nRiding high off of Boy-Cott-In the Industry, Classified released his eleventh album Hitch Hikin\\&amp;#039; Music. Produced like previous albums by Classified himself, it is arguably some of Classified\\&amp;#039;s finest work. On \\&quot;Fall From Paradise\\&quot;, Classified reflects on the difficulty of staying fresh and on top. In the hip hop meets rock song \\&quot;All About U\\&quot;, featuring singer Chad Hatcher, Classified shows the extent of his growth from his early releases. He eschews the current bling-bling culture of popular hip hop to remind people that life is not about trying to impress others. In \\&quot;Hip Hop Star,\\&quot; he muses about how some people act like he\\&amp;#039;s a major celebrity, while others ask \\&quot;when the hell he\\&amp;#039;s gonna make it\\&quot;. The rest of the album includes guest appearances by Jay Bizzy, Mic Boyd, Jordan Croucher, Preacher K, White Mic and more. Four singles have been released off the album: \\&quot;Find Out\\&quot; (which won the 2007 East Coast Music Award for Best Rap/Hip-Hop Single[1]), \\&quot;Feelin\\&amp;#039; Fine Remix\\&quot;, \\&quot;All About U\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Hard to Be Hip Hop\\&quot;.\n\n\n\nThis torrent includes \nBoy-Cott-In the IndustryÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2005 \nHitch Hikin\\&amp;#039; Music ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ 2006 \nin mp3 format @ 192kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3e6155608521056b2fa01c6e0b0394e3a44555b","amp;dn":"Classified+-+Boy-Cott-In+the+Industry+and+Hitch+Hikin+Music","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3e6155608521056b2fa01c6e0b0394e3a44555b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,230,21,86,8,82,16,86,178,250,1,198,224,176,57,78,58,68,85,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
