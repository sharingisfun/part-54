Drupal, like many modern CMSs, allows the system administrator to create and organize content, customize the presentation, automate administrative tasks, and manage site visitors and contributors. Although there is a sophisticated programming interface, most tasks can be accomplished with little or no programming. Drupal is sometimes described as a &quot;web application framework,&quot; as its capabilities extend from content management to enabling a wide range of services and transactions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9cbf79e540c556dfd997f4db0351f38747fdea8","amp;dn":"Drupal+6.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9cbf79e540c556dfd997f4db0351f38747fdea8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,203,247,158,84,12,85,109,253,153,127,77,176,53,31,56,116,127,222,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
