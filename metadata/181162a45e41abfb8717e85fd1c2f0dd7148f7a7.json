None of it was recovered. Nobody was ever arrested. The robbery made headlines\n for a few days and then disappeared - the result of a &amp;#039;D&amp;#039; Notice, gagging the press. \nThis film reveals what was hidden for the first time. The story involves murder, corruption\n and a sex scandal with links to the Royal Family - a story in which the thieves were the \nmost innocent people involved.\n                                                                                                                                                                \n  \n  \n                     &lt;a href=&quot; http://imdb.com/title/tt0200465/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://imdb.com/title/tt0200465/&lt;/a&gt;\n                      \n   We said it once before and we will say it again.
