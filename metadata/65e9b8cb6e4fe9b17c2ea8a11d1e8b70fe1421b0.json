Filmed in\n      France and selected as the French entry in the San Francisco\n      Film Festival, Melvin's film was awarded the top prize. Saying\n      it was controversial would be an understatement. In 1968 for a\n      black man to walk up to the podium and accept the top festival\n      award for a film he had to go abroad to make--now that's how\n      you make your mark. After his comedy, Watermelon Man, Melvin\n      was determined to push the Hollywood boundaries with the\n      groundbreaking, and even more controversial, Sweet Sweetback's\n      Baadasssss Song. Turned down by every major studio including\n      Columbia, where he had a three-picture deal, Melvin was forced\n      to basically self-finance. Risking everything he had Melvin\n      delivered to the world the first Black Ghetto hero on the big\n      screen--whether they were ready or not! More than 30 years\n      later, history is being fashioned again in the telling of this\n      very tale. Mario Van Peebles, Melvin's son, directs an honest\n      and revealing portrait of his pioneering father. Mario now\n      tells the story of the making of Melvin Van Peebles' landmark\n      1971 film, Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, including\n      Melvin's struggles to raise money to fund the film under the\n      guise of creating a black porno film. Melvin had ducked\n      creditors, the unions and had to bail out his camera crew\n      after they were arrested because a white cop decided a bunch\n      of Negroes and hippies couldn't have come by that camera\n      equipment honestly. Despite death threats and temporarily\n      losing sight in one eye, Melvin somehow managed to whip into\n      shape a rag-tag, multi-racial crew and finish the film that\n      would give birth to birth of a new era which was about to\n      explode: Independent Black Cinema.\n\n\n                Cast             \n\n\n      Mario Van Peebles.....................Melvin Van Peebles\n      Joy Bryant.....................................Priscilla\n      T.K.
