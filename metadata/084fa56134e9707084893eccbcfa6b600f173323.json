This film about consumerism totally consumed us. It used the language of music video, propaganda and commercial advertising as a response to the forces of globalisation. It fights fire with fire. The questions it raises are ultimately more important than any answers it might suggest. And we believe audiences can only profit from the debate that will ensue. For its originality, sense of humour, irony, forcefulness and visual virtuosity, the Silver Wolf Award goes to SURPLUS.&amp;quot; The Jury of the International Documentary Filmfestival in Amsterdam, Nov.2003.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:084fa56134e9707084893eccbcfa6b600f173323","amp;dn":"Surplus%3A+Terrorized+into+being+consumers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"084fa56134e9707084893eccbcfa6b600f173323","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,79,165,97,52,233,112,112,132,137,62,204,188,250,107,96,15,23,51,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
