This week, we travel to the city of Baltimore to tell the stories of some of the people living there.\n\nBaltimore was once America&amp;#039;s third largest city, and second largest port. Today, the port is a shadow of its former self, industry has fled, and the population has been declining for decades.\n\nEconomic hardship and racial disparity are major factors in Baltimore&amp;#039;s notorious crime statistics: nearly 300 murders a year, linked to a deadly heroin trade that fuels hundreds of deaths by overdose.\n\nThe murder rate is nearly seven times the US national rate - making Baltimore more deadly than Bogota.\n\nLast year Baltimore was the second most dangerous city in the US with a population of more than 500,000. Frontline USA lifts the lid on the problems the city is facing, and hears from a cross-section of Baltimore citizens trying to make the city a better place to live.\n\nDonnie Andrews was released from prison two years ago. A former drug kingpin and convicted murderer, he is now spending his time trying to negotiate a truce between warring gangs.\n\nHe had been one of Baltimore&amp;#039;s most notorious criminals - parts of Donnie&amp;#039;s story have been immortalized. One of the main characters in the hit TV show, The Wire, is based on him - Omar Little.\n\nWe also speak to the police, who admit that Baltimore&amp;#039;s streets are like a war zone.\n\nBut no matter how dangerous and deadly the streets get, we found many of the city&amp;#039;s people rising to the challenge with fresh ideas about the best way to tackle Baltimore&amp;#039;s problems.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/8C10A4C6...-23A757178182.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/8C10A4C6...-23A757178182.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\ncap-shunster ex ?
