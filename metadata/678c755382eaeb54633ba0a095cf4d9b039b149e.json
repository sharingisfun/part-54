I agree wholeheartedly after giving Corroding From Inside a thorough listen. Usually, I debase doppelgangers because I feel that they don?t offer enough redeeming values to thwart the ones they?re copycatting. However, once in a great while, an identical twin emerges that crafts something both irrevocably presentable and endearing. Searing Meadow do indeed fit that bill.\n\nThis band differs from Amorphis insomuch that the former?s melodious nature is at the forefront. A clean guitar sound plays a significant role on Corroding From Inside, as does the muddiness of the distortion-laden, background passages. I wish Ikonen?s (vocals, guitars, keyboards) vox were more upfront, though his versatility is nice. Songs such as ?All Obvious? and ?These Evening Tears? both feature incredible breakdowns. Concerning the breakdown of the latter: is it a throwback to Megadeth?s ?Peace Sells??? I?ll let you decide on that one. Synthesizers play a pivotal role like ?Three Names for Denial? and ?Fading to Silhouette (Part II)? show us. It?s unfortunate that the presentation wasn?t brought up to scale with the music, because this Finnish quartet has more to offer than their packaging lets on.\n\n[Insert connecting phrase here], I like these guys in spite of their penchant for laminating the Amorphis sound, and running with it. Corroding From Inside is basically melancholia splayed out in musical form, and it?s easy to identify with many of the themes present in the lyrics. Without a doubt, Searing Meadow are for those of you that get misty when you hear mid-90?s, Finnish death. \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://musicbrainz.org/release/c06b6177-242f-4726-8e08-c408534318eb.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://musicbrainz.org/release/c06b6177-242f-4726-8e08-c408534318eb.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=16818&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=16818&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:678c755382eaeb54633ba0a095cf4d9b039b149e","amp;dn":"Searing+Meadow+%282005%29+-+Corroding+From+Inside+%2AFinnish+MeloDeath","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"678c755382eaeb54633ba0a095cf4d9b039b149e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,140,117,83,130,234,235,84,99,59,160,160,149,207,77,155,3,155,20,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
