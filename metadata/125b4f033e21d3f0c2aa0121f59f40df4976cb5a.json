Nice to see those guys are using a &amp;#039;illegal&amp;#039; source to make their trainers also since the game is not retail yet. Hell maybe they even downloaded it from TPB? :)\n\nAgain they were very quick in getting a &amp;#039;promo&amp;#039; trainer at gamecopyworld.com. Quite frankly I am dissapointed with GCW even allowing this bullshit on their site.\n\n\nNo you will not be cashing in on game cheating CH, not on my watch.\n\nFree for the people, by the people.\n\nEnjoy guys.\n\nThere is two trainers in this one, one for DX9 and one for DX10.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:125b4f033e21d3f0c2aa0121f59f40df4976cb5a","amp;dn":"Assassins_Creed_Plus6_Trainer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"125b4f033e21d3f0c2aa0121f59f40df4976cb5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,91,79,3,62,33,211,240,194,170,1,33,245,159,64,223,73,118,203,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
