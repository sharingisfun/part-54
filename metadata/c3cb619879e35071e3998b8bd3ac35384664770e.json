Based on the 1979 double album &amp;quot;The Wall&amp;quot; by Pink Floyd, the film begins in Pink's youth where he is crushed by the love of his mother. Several years later he is punished by the teachers in school because he is starting to write poems. Slowly he begins to build a wall around himself to be protected from the world outside. The film shows all this in massive and epic pictures until the very end where he tears down the wall and breaks free.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3cb619879e35071e3998b8bd3ac35384664770e","amp;dn":"Pink+Floyd+The+Wall+%281982%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3cb619879e35071e3998b8bd3ac35384664770e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,203,97,152,121,227,80,113,227,153,139,139,211,172,53,56,70,100,119,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
