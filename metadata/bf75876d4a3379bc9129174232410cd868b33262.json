While waiting for her co-worker, \nshe stumbles upon a secret meeting between a North Korean and a Middle Eastern-looking man that proves to be a\n deadly day. When violence breaks out, a stray bullet hits her smack in the center of her forehead and leaves \nher staggering for the door. Miraculously only dazed, she grabs a mysterious cylinder from the cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© floor, \nthus making off with a clone of George W. Bush&amp;#039;s finger. And then things get really weird. Sachiko discovers\n odd psychic abilities and begins imagining various theories of the universe and multivalent philosophical \nspeculations, all to the throb of techno. While she pursues arcane poststrucuturalist knowledgeÃƒÂ¢??and has \nintellectual intercourse with a political philosopherÃƒÂ¢??a consortium of bad guy terrorists chase her in the hopes of \nrecovering the cylinder.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf75876d4a3379bc9129174232410cd868b33262","amp;dn":"%5BBikkuri%5D+The+Glamorous+Life+of+Sachiko+Hanai+%5BXvid+640+x+352%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf75876d4a3379bc9129174232410cd868b33262","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,117,135,109,74,51,121,188,145,41,23,66,50,65,12,216,104,179,50,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
