Please report to me about these bugs and difficulties, and I will do my best to fix it until the next release.\n\nI only have a 100kb/s upload line, so PLEASE SEED when you are done downloading. Even 10 to 20kb/s is helping!\nOn a good day I am able to make and test one release, so I will try and update with new releases for you.\nComment and tell me, and other users, about what needs to be changed, and I will do my best!\nBe patient, it will be worth it!\n\n\n#Unattended install\n#Stripped down, occupies 1gb on its own\n#Runs fast!\n#A couple of extra programs installed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd00b8a78df53b71c6e34688cdcf22c1463533b5","amp;dn":"2Vast+XP+SP2+Beta+3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd00b8a78df53b71c6e34688cdcf22c1463533b5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,0,184,167,141,245,59,113,198,227,70,136,205,207,34,193,70,53,51,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
