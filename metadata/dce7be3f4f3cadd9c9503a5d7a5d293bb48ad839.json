Due to his preference of heavy, radical and highly complex sound- and songstructures, he decided to work with this kind of stuff ? one of those many side projects saw the light of the day. However, Joe P. had produced all the tracks only instrumental and refrained from their release for quite a long time. In 1996 this story began. The main focus of Joe P. was at that time on the band IMPRESSIONS OF WINTER, which had realized the first CD releases at Spirit Prductions. Through experience with Impressions Of Winter Joe P. had acquainted a lot of knowledge in composition and sound design. Anyway, Impressions Of Winter was always more important and the high standard of quality and partly breathtakin&amp;#039; atmosphere of IOW cast a spell on many listeners. The CARNIVORA songs were remixed over and over again and Joe P., according to his great expectations, didn&amp;#039;t see himself able to release this material till the year 2003. After the improvments of his studio and first attempts to record vocals (stipulated by IOW-productions) Joe P. considered discharging the material with lyrics and he even thought about a lead singer. This singer was found in Joe B. A friend of both made the two known, and, sharing many interests musically, it soon became clear that this cooperation was going to bear its fruits. By the way, the names of the band members are accidentally identical - Joe P.`s full name is Joachim Proell, Joe B.`s full name is Joachim Bleil. Another strange accident that brought the two even closer together. Joe B. was predisposed as a lead singer, as he had enjoyed the priviledge of singing lessons for a long while; after many failed attempts to found a band himself, he welcomed Joe P.`s suggestion to join the project. After some difficulty finding his identity in the band right in the beginning, he soon became familiar with his role in the band and the new songs and even developed ideas for lyrics and melodies and thus found himself his place in CARNIVORA. Sheer melodical vocals were avoided from beginning on; Joe B.`s abilities concerning &quot;real&quot; singing will be taken into account in later productions. TOPICS: CARNIVORA deals lyrically with disgraceful states of the society and ugly human deeds that inevitably result from that kind of society we all live in. This is often depicted from the victim-side, the woman, who calls for vengeance after being tortured or abused. The philosophical and cultural question of this kind of vengeance in its most drastic way is one of CARNIVORAs main topics; often described the way it actually is: cruel and merciless. With our administration of law, that does not assign too strict penalty for sexual abuse it is only human for the members of CARNIVORA to have bloody thoughts of revenge in their minds. CARNIVORA does not intend any calls for violence; nevertheless they try to grasp the topic with all its brutality. Other topics are surely planned but the main emphasis will remain on this dark side of human existance. THE MUSICAL STYLE: Due to the fact that there are less and less bands using heavy, intelligent sequences and interesting samples, CARNIVORA sees itself responsible for keeping this style (generally known as EBM) alive. CARNIVORA produces multi-layered, heavy electronic music far away from boring and monotonous Futurepop or cheap german stereotype-industrial, spoilt with movie samples. In this times it is very hard to get a record deal, but CARNIVORA is still workin&amp;#039; for it. And they will produce new songs, perhaps for the release via website.  \n \nGENRE.....
