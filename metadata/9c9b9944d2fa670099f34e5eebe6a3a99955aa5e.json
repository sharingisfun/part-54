It is current up to the 3rd year anniversary podcast #144 entitled: Aldous Huxley - The Ultimate Revolution!\n\nLorenzo Hagerty is a real cool guy that&amp;#039;s been putting these podcast together for some time now and features talks by such notable thinkers as Terrence McKenna, Eric Davis, Timothy Leary, Matt Pallamary, Rick Doblin, Alex Grey, Sasha &amp; Ann Shulgin, and more.  The topics, while relating often to the use of psychedelics and their import, range from such things as creating the future to visionary art and culture.\n\nLorenzo has also created the web page - www.matrixmasters.net which contains much of the same material.\n\nIf you like this collection, which is also available on iTunes, then be sure to donate to the Psychedelic Salon, and get involved with the conversations from fellow Saloners at the Grow Report Forum provided by the dopefiend.co.uk podcast network, as well as the comments section in the Notes from the Psychedelic Salon over at www.psychedelicsalon.org!!!\n\nEnjoy!\n\nps\nI did not include full track listing, but you can search the sites mentioned above for further details.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c9b9944d2fa670099f34e5eebe6a3a99955aa5e","amp;dn":"Psychedelic+Salon+Podcast++","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c9b9944d2fa670099f34e5eebe6a3a99955aa5e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,155,153,68,210,250,103,0,153,243,78,94,235,230,163,169,153,85,170,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
