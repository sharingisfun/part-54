BLUSIRKUT subtly blends 'St. Germaine' style riffs and 'Thievery Corporation' beats with the improvisational dynamic of a live band - infusing their long and distinguished history as industry leading jazz/funk musicians with cutting edge technology.  \n\n     Initially introduced to each other through Karl Denson, these virtuosos have played venues around the world from the Fillmore in San Francisco to Madison Square Garden and the Blue Note in Tokyo.  They have pioneered ground-breaking grooves on a global stage for years and now they have unleashed their full talent and imagination into this deliciously experimental live dance music, surpassing all expectations and leaving current dance culture in the dust.\n\n     What started as a collaboration in the recording studio quickly became a full blown project to explore new styles (Hip-Hop, Nu-Jazz, Drum-&amp;-Bass, etc.), ultimately harvesting the best qualities of these sounds to perform live what most musicians can only accomplish in a studio.  BLUSIRKUT is the sublime union of technology and talent, experience and enlightenment - serving as a platform for the next generation of production, composition &amp; expression. Armed with an arsenal of digital tools - combined with a stunning array of traditional instruments and techniques - their sole intent is simple, they make you move... and they're good at it...\n\n\n\nBLUSIRKUT IS:\n\n    Chris Littlefield] - Trumpet/Keys\n    David Veith] - Keys/Synth Bass\n    Ryan Krieger - Drums/Programming\n    Josh Surheinrich ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar/Strings\n    Alton Parker - Visuals/Light\n\n\n\nBLUSIRKUT COMMUNITY\nhttp://www.tribes.tribe.net/blusirkut\nhttp://www.jambase.com/profiles/blusirkut\nhttp://www.blusirkut.stumbleupon.com/\n\nBLUSIRKUT VIDEOS\nhttp://www.gofish.com/channel/blusirkut\n\nBLUSIRKUT MUSIC\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/blusirkut\nhttp://www.blusirkut.podomatic.com/\nhttp://www.sonicbids.com/blusirkut\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87a5c5a107981d01dd6a2f359ea92fe17a110324","amp;dn":"BLUSIRKUT+%28of+Karl+Densons+Tiny+Universe%29+Live+At+Crystal+Bay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87a5c5a107981d01dd6a2f359ea92fe17a110324","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,165,197,161,7,152,29,1,221,106,47,53,158,169,47,225,122,17,3,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
