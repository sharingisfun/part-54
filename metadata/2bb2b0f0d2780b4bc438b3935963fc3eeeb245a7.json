For example there are numerous shots of pigs, gory pig slaughters, a man pretending to be a chicken, a girl dragging said man, a girl dragging a dead chicken, many people in masks, the burning of a dead goat, the sitting next to people on a bench while a weirdo with a road sign runs past scene, the voyeuristic scene of a girl playing with herself, many weird people in bizarre costumes in alleys or hounding our main character in the street, etc. Supposedly about failed love and it may be saying something about foreigners and social-racial difficulties but what it really means is anyones guess. This is too incoherent to even be surreal.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439015/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0439015/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2bb2b0f0d2780b4bc438b3935963fc3eeeb245a7","amp;dn":"Pig-Chicken+Suicide","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2bb2b0f0d2780b4bc438b3935963fc3eeeb245a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,178,176,240,210,120,11,75,196,56,179,147,89,99,252,62,238,178,69,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
