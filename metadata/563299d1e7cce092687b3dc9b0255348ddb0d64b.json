Surreal, gory and slow (in a good way), with amazing music. Eerie, cold and haunting analogue synthesizers. So damn good. \n\nThe nights of terror are unleashed when a professor&amp;#039;s thirst for knowledge seals his own demise as he unwittingly unseals a cursed underground crypt in an ancient burial ground!\n\nThe desecrated graveyard erupts with a ground swell of ravenous, rotting, flesh-hungry zombies that shamble into the night in search of living human prey! On the adjoining grounds, a group of clueless, decadent socialites are enjoying a wild weekend retreat of debauchery. Among the eccentric guests are a nympho mother and her freakish, incestuous son, played by Peter Parker (Pietro Barcella)\n\nEncoded with DVD-Shrink. Untouched.\n\nPicture: 1.85:1 Anamorphic WS\n\nSound: DD2.0\n\nSubtitles: None\n\nFormat: NTSC\n\nExtras:\n\n# Still and poster gallery\n# Trailers\n# Talent Bios\n# Exclusive interviews\n\nEnjoy!\n\n--------------\n\nCheck my other uploads for more Arthouse, Sleaze, Italo-Westerns, Horror, Cannibals, Sexploitation soundtracks and other weird and cult cinema.\t\t\t ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:563299d1e7cce092687b3dc9b0255348ddb0d64b","amp;dn":"Burial+Ground+%28Le+notti+del+terrore%29+-+Andrea+Bianchi+1980","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"563299d1e7cce092687b3dc9b0255348ddb0d64b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,50,153,209,231,204,224,146,104,123,61,201,176,37,83,72,221,176,214,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
