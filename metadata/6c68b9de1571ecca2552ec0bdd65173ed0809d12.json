Only the personnel changed; Barney Kessel took over from Mundell Lowe, while Joe Comfort stood in for George Duvivier on bass. The results are excellent, highlighting the power of Vaughan&amp;#039;s voice, whether she&amp;#039;s singing a rosy &quot;All I Do Is Dream of You&quot; or one of the most turgid torch songs, &quot;All or Nothing at All.&quot; Her best feature is &quot;When Sunny Gets Blue,&quot; a spotlight for her dynamic range. ~All Music Guide\n\nPersonel:\nSarah Vaughan :Vocalist\nJoe Comfort :Bass\nBarney Kessel :Guitar\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.
