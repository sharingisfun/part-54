Recorded 1988-08-14, first broadcast 1988-09-13. \n\nKev Hopper - bass\nChris Salmon - guitars\nRob McKahey - drums\nMick Lynch - vox\n\n01 The Song&amp;#039;s Remains\n02 Thelma\n03 Strayte &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; Narrow\n04 Seven Sisters\n\nSound quality isn&amp;#039;t wonderful, coming from 2nd generation tape. There&amp;#039;s a wee bit of hiss and John Peel can be heard over the music in a couple of places. The edits are a bit ropey, too and there&amp;#039;s even some fluctuation of recording level at the beginning of &quot;Strayte &amp;#039;n&amp;#039; Narrow&quot; but, hey, it&amp;#039;s very listenable and I&amp;#039;ve never seen it elsewhere, so if you feel like moaning, don&amp;#039;t. Just give us a better version instead.\n\nStump&amp;#039;s 2nd Peel session is here: http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4253430  \nStump&amp;#039;s 3rd Peel session is here: http://thepiratebay.se/tor/4253439\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ee9847abf39e5023038d377125a73ab2581fceb","amp;dn":"Stump+-+4th+Peel+Session","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ee9847abf39e5023038d377125a73ab2581fceb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,233,132,122,191,57,229,2,48,56,211,119,18,90,115,171,37,129,252,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
