Like his music with System of a Down, Tankian's solo work is highly progressive, blending metal, industrial, acoustic passages, and jazz and classical flourishes in one bone-crushing, carnivalesque mindwarp.\n\nOpener &quot;Empty Walls&quot; crosses crunching metal with the drama of an operatic aria (vintage Queen is a clear touchstone for Tankian), while &quot;Sky Is Over&quot; rides a dirgey, yet catchy chorus, and &quot;The Unthinking Majority&quot; continues Tankian's relentless political and social critique. Tankian performed nearly all the instrumental and vocal tracks himself making this complex and unclassifiable labor of love all the more impressive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21c3a8399e8a1647d8ba8fa935343fff9e318f39","amp;dn":"Serj+Tankian+-+Elect+the+Dead","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21c3a8399e8a1647d8ba8fa935343fff9e318f39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,195,168,57,158,138,22,71,216,186,143,169,53,52,63,255,158,49,143,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
