Since 3/4 of all nav systems use denso, it was just a matter of using a recent disc, in this case from a GM and changing the headers to match those of an existing kenwood disc. This should give you maps and POI as of 2007 and seems to work so far. This is a disc for the eastern half of the USA/Canada. Don&amp;#039;t forget that you have to burn this as a DVD-ROM, so something like ImageBurn should have no problem with it. Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b54bb35d63a8d02c80e96b49077fc52dc16d3b7c","amp;dn":"Kenwood+KNA-DV4100+Navigation+USA+East+2007+Update+Map+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b54bb35d63a8d02c80e96b49077fc52dc16d3b7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,75,179,93,99,168,208,44,128,233,107,73,7,127,197,45,193,109,59,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
