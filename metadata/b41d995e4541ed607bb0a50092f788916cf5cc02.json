Really funny, but also a film with a heart.\n\nAlthough I am not Swedish, I must reluctantly admit that Swedish is the most widely understood language in Scandinavia, so I have hardcoded the Swedish subtitles because of the quotes from Shakespeare. You non-Scandinavians can just ignore them; simply imagine that you are on vacation in Sweden.\n\nFullscreen, good stereo\n\nXviD 512x352 25 fps, two-pass, AC3. Source: PAL native.\n\nBurn tested, runs well in my divX player.\n\n128 min, so I gave it 800 Mb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b41d995e4541ed607bb0a50092f788916cf5cc02","amp;dn":"Renaissance+Man+%281994%29+Mark+Wahlberg+SWESUB+DVDrip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b41d995e4541ed607bb0a50092f788916cf5cc02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,29,153,94,69,65,237,96,123,176,165,0,146,247,136,145,108,245,204,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
