Even with that file included in the RAR,\n       many of those questions come up all the time.\n\nThis is a bugfix release and adds no new features.\n\nQwix 1.01 fixes:\n\n - Reworked FTP transfer buffers for improved Windows\n   performance during and after transfers, which can\n   also increase transfer speeds (especially boost mode).\n\n - Changed default transfer buffer size from 512KB to 1MB.\n\n - Fixed a transfer thread leak which caused various\n   problems with Qwix after transferring an ISO.\n\n - Fixed a problem that prevented game icons from being\n   downloaded after transferring an ISO.\n\n - Fixed a problem that prevented batch properties from\n   taking effect if you pushed a button on the toolbar\n   before clicking in any other control first.\n\n - Made the XBE rename case-sensitive when deciding\n   whether it should rewrite the XBE file or not.\n\n - Disabled the &amp;quot;Use advanced Avalaunch features&amp;quot; option\n   in the connection editor until the SITE REFRESH\n   command is fixed in Avalaunch.  Yes, that's all that\n   the option does.  No, it doesn't make transfers slower.\n\n - Fixed the taskbar disappearing act and an occasional\n   OLE32.DLL access violation, both on Win98/WinME.\n\n - Fixed a few font and color issues, making things a bit\n   more consistent with certain themes and platforms.\n\n - Fixed a problem that prevented a transfer to the\n   root directory of an Xbox drive.\n\n - Fixed a random access violation that was caused by\n   the component used for all the lists and trees in\n   the Qwix user interface.\n\n - Made the local PC folder browser show the proper folder\n   name for shortcut items like My Network Places shares.\n\n - Fixed the Rename ISO feature from the Scan Folders\n   right-click (from the Load ISO screen, not Scan Titles).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b1b9a1735ae8582288ea2c74d798ef49d4d86ef","amp;dn":"Qwix101.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b1b9a1735ae8582288ea2c74d798ef49d4d86ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,27,154,23,53,174,133,130,40,142,162,199,77,121,142,244,157,77,134,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
