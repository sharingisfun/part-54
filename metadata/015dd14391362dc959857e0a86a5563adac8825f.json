So silky \nand fluid as to sound almost effortless, Green's vocals revel \nin the lush strings and evocative horns of Willie Mitchell's \nsuperbly intimate production, barely rising above an angelic \nwhisper for the gossamer &amp;quot;Have You Been Making Out O.K..&amp;quot;\n With barely perceptible changes in mood, Call Me covers \nremarkable ground, spanning from &amp;quot;Stand Up&amp;quot; -- a call to \narms delivered with characteristic understatement -- to \nrenditions of Hank Williams' &amp;quot;I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry&amp;quot; \nand Willie Nelson's &amp;quot;Funny How Time Slips Away,&amp;quot; both of \nthem exemplary fusions of country and soul. Equally \ncompelling are the album's three Top Ten hits -- &amp;quot;You Ought \nto Be With Me,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Here I Am (Come and Take Me),&amp;quot; and the \nshimmering title cut. A classic.\n\nenjoy and seed :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:015dd14391362dc959857e0a86a5563adac8825f","amp;dn":"Al+Green+-+Call+Me+%28Soul-1973%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"015dd14391362dc959857e0a86a5563adac8825f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,93,209,67,145,54,45,201,89,133,126,10,134,165,86,58,218,200,130,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
