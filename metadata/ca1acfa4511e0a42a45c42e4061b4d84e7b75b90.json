Although oil Companies are sending less oil into the market, risking a smaller buffer against supply interruption, oil companies are making unprecedented profits.\nShell, one of the seven oil companies which controls the world oil markets, made more than $27bn dollars in 2007. Exxon Mobil&amp;#039;s net profit rose to $40.6bn last year, with sales exceeding $404bn, which is more than the gross domestic product of 120 countries.\nThen there are the governments of importing countries - when you pay high prices at the fuel pump, that is more because of taxes than anything else - from the 26 per cent the US government receives, to as high as 53 per cent and 58 per cent in France and Britain respectively.\nNow with oil prices exceeding $117 a barrel, Inside Story asks how far it is likely to continue soaring, where is all the wealth going and are there any serious efforts to develop alternative energy resources?\n\n\nCap shunster ex: \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca1acfa4511e0a42a45c42e4061b4d84e7b75b90","amp;dn":"Inside+Story+-+Big+Oil+Gets+Bigger+%3F+2008+04+20+%28Al-Jazeera%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca1acfa4511e0a42a45c42e4061b4d84e7b75b90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,26,207,164,81,30,10,66,164,92,66,228,6,27,77,132,231,183,91,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
