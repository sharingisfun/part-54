Filmed on 5 continents, Six Degrees tracks the world's top climate researchers and follows ranchers, photographers and everyday people to uncover the hidden signs and climate trends. From Greenland's ice sheet to tropical ocean coral reefs, from Himalayan glaciers to the Amazon rainforest, come chilling firsthand accounts of climate change already underway - and evidence of more to come. As global warming reaches into the lives of ordinary people, scientists on the frontlines race against the clock to determine if the climate models are right and if they are, how bad things could get. As the mercury rises, what could the next century of climate change really look and feel like? Super-realistic computer graphics, stunning high definition imagery and the world's most remote and spectacular locations provide an unprecedented preview into a potentially catastrophic future. The journey of Six Degrees concludes with an examination of solutions, both great and small, we can use to defuse the global warming time bomb.\n\nFile Name ..........: National.Geographic.Six.Degrees.Could.Change.the.World.XviD.AC3.avi\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 1,493.01 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\n\nVideo Length .......: 01:36:05\nVideo Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1980 KB/s\nResolution .........: 640 x 352\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.81:1\nFramerate ..........: 29.97 FPS\nQuality Factor .....: 0.293 B/px\n\nAudio Codec Name ...: FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 192 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dee147dde387d60fd0733b4157b4a902b1479feb","amp;dn":"National.Geographic.Six.Degrees.Could.Change.the.World.XviD.AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dee147dde387d60fd0733b4157b4a902b1479feb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,225,71,221,227,135,214,15,208,115,59,65,87,180,169,2,177,71,159,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
