Rapid Hacker v3.7 has been released. There&amp;#039;s\nsome Secret(ish) stuff I have put in to this for you rapid share\ndatabase snoops. You can easily browse the files hosted on their\nsite using this program, and once you figure out how I did it, you\ncan do it w/out RH, but for downloading on demand, it&amp;#039;s recommended\nthat you use RH, because of not having to wait forever. \n\nIf incase you get a Yes/Cancel debug error, it is a Server backend issue\nwhich I have no power to rectify. Click cancel, and continue on using\nRapid Hacker.\n\nScreenshot: http://i49.photobucket.com/albums/f253/xyr0x/Screenshot.jpg\n\n\nI&amp;#039;ve also revamped the UI, to match the Website. And, have included\nfilefindz as an onboard feature to attract my friend as well as a \nDDL Feature for Rapid Hacker. \n\nRegards,\nxyr0x - June 23rd, 2008","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c189a3076a1723abe3d0178c974d6002c3b59530","amp;dn":"Rapid+Hacker+v3.7+Final+Edition+%5BInstallation+Fixed%5D+-+by+xyr0x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c189a3076a1723abe3d0178c974d6002c3b59530","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,137,163,7,106,23,35,171,227,208,23,140,151,77,96,2,195,181,149,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
