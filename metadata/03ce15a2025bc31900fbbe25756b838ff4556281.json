It is of Mount and Blade Version .903 (ACTIVATED). I am still somewhat skeptical if the Activation will roll over from my computer, to yours, so I zipped the ENTIRE GAME to your computer.\n\n\nMount and Blade is a Strategy Game created by Taleworlds, an Husband and Wife Developer Team. Its only 15 Bucks for a LEGAL Copy, I highly recommend you actually buy the game as it is great, and its pretty cheap. Its still in the Beta, and it has a very good Modding Community with a &quot;Module System&quot; that allows it to switch between mods with the click of a button at the Main Menu. It is a Roleplaying/Real Time Strategy Game, it is a very unique and special game that you will enjoy. Well Have fun.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructions\n\n-----------------\nExtract Demo.zip (I put it like that to fool ISPs, they started to figure out when people were pirating games) To C:\\Program Files\\Talewords\\Mount&amp;Blade\n\nAfter that go to your Desktop and right-click, go to new-&gt;Shortcut and put in the file path C:\\Program Files\\Taleworlds\\Mount&amp;Blade\\Mount&amp;Blade.exe\n\nAfter that, click the Shortcut, and enojoy\n\n\nSystem Specifications\n\nWindows XP\n-------------\n514 RAM\n2.5Ghz Processor\n64Mb Graphics Card\n\nWindows Vista\n------------\n3Ghz Processor\n1024mb RAM\n64mb Graphics Card\n\n\n\n\nAny Questions about this game, or any issues contact me at &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;58343d34372d3b3034393528392a372d3f3d183f35393134763b373576&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03ce15a2025bc31900fbbe25756b838ff4556281","amp;dn":"Mount+and+Blade+Version+.903","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03ce15a2025bc31900fbbe25756b838ff4556281","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,206,21,162,2,91,195,25,0,251,190,37,117,107,131,143,244,85,98,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
