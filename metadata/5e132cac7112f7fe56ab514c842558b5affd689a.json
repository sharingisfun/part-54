Outtro \n\nNOTE (from Mike&amp;#039;s U2 Trading run by Mike Duchek): \n\nScott Zumsteg (Taper): \nThis is my version of Syracuse which is the same source I had for Denver and Tempe. \nThis originally came off a sony crew VHS video where just the audio portion was put to \nDAT. I have always had this version so I dont know how it differs to others. Mine cuts in \nthe last minute of &quot;With or Without You&quot;. This tape has a little more high end than Los \nAngeles but also a little bit more background mic noize as since it was being used simply as \na prop for the lighting guys, not a ton of effort was done by sony to make a a1 mix of it. \n\nMike Duchek: \nScott&amp;#039;s version, while being the best in terms of sound quality, was however incomplete \n(see above) and played too fast. Another version I had, &quot;JT Syracuse&quot; played at the right \nspeed and was complete, so I decided to fix Scott&amp;#039;s version, and add the missing portion \nwhere Scott&amp;#039;s cuts out.  I would rate Scott&amp;#039;s version as A Soundboard and JT Syracuse at \nB+/A-. I first corrected the speed, then added the last part of the show where it faded \nout. I did no other remastering. This should therefore be the best version of this show out \nthere. \n\nCT&amp;#039;s notes: I got these FLAC&amp;#039;s directly from Mike without a CDr gen in between.
