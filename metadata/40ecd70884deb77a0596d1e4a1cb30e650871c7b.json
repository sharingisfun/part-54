There is another version on here (that i didn&amp;#039;t upload myself), which i DID make.  But it&amp;#039;s an early version and doesn&amp;#039;t have all the DLC songs as stated in the description. And the person who uploaded the other included the WRONG nfo.  This one, is uploaded by me and you WILL get all the songs in the description.\n\n\n\nGuitar Hero 3 Custom - Rock Band Edition - by CosmoKramer\n\nALL DIFFICULTIES\nGUITAR ONLY - NO BASS \n\nIncludes every Rock Band Song from the mainsetlist, 4 of the bonus songs, 21 DLC songs, and The Devil Went Down To Geogia  from the GH3 Xbox DLC.  This is the OFFICIAL Rock Band songs with the same exact audio from the actual game.  The guitar cuts off if you miss a note.  The crowd sings along on some songs just like in the game.  The guitarist animations actually go with the song (take a look when your playing) and moves his hand, and stops when there is no music.  \n\nEnjoy.\n\nNOTE: LOWER THE &quot;BAND&quot; VOLUME TO ABOUT 7 OR SO IN THE AUDIO OPTIONS FOR BEST SOUND. Or make the &quot;Band&quot; volume two lower than the guitar... If your Guitar Volume is 9...then make the Band Volume 7.  Experiment for best sound.\n\n\nTier 1\nHere It Goes Again - OK Go\nIn Bloom - Nirvana\nMaps - Yeah Yeah Yeah&amp;#039;s\nMississippi Queen - Mountain\nShould I Stay Or Should I Go - The Clash\nTime We Had - Motherhips\n\nTier 2\nBlitzkrieg Bop - The Ramones\nThe Hand That Feeds - Nine Inch Nails\nI Think I&amp;#039;m Paranoid - Garbage\nWave Of Mutilation - Pixies\nOrange Crush - R.E.M.\nDay Late, Dollar Short - The Acro-Bats\n\nTier 3\nDetroit Rock City - KISS\nGo With The Flow - Queens of the Stone Age\nLearn To Fly - Foo Fighter\nSabatoge - Beastie Boys\nSay It Ain&amp;#039;t So - Weezer\n29 Fingers - The Konks\n\nTier 4\nCelebrity Skin - Hole\nCreep - Radiohead\nElectric Version - The New Pornographers\nWhen You Were Young - The Killers\nGimme Shelter - Rolling Stones\nBrainpower - Freezepop\n\nTier 5\nBlack Hole Sun - Soundgarden\nEpic - Faith No More\nMain Offender - The Hives\nReptillia - The Strokes\nSuffragette City - David Bowie\nPleasure Pleasure - Bang Camaro\n\nTier 6\nAre You Gonna Be My Girl - Jet\nDani California - Red Hot Chili Peppers\nParanoid - Black Sabbath\nWanted Dead or Alive - Bon Jovi\nDon&amp;#039;t Fear The Reaper - Blue Oyster Cult\nFlirtin&amp;#039; With Disaster - Molly Hatchet\n\nTier 7\nBallroom Blitz - Sweet\nDead on Arrival - Fall Out Boy\nNext To You - The Police\nVasoline - Stone Temple Pilots\nWon&amp;#039;t Get Fooled Again - The Who\n\nTier 8\nEnter Sandman - Metallica\nTrain Kept a Rollin - Aerosmith\nHighway Star - Deep Purple\nGreen Grass and High Tides - The Outlaws\n\nBonus\nRun To The Hills - Iron Maiden\nTom Sawyer - Rush\nForeplay Long Time - Boston\nWelcome Home - Coheed &amp; Cambria\nBlackened - Metallica \nMy Sharona - The Knack\nRide The Lightning - Metallica\nAnd Justice For All - Metallica\nThe Devil Went Down To Georgia - FULL GH3 \nLast Train To Clarksville - The Monkees\nDon&amp;#039;t Look Back At Anger - Oasis\nRoxanne - The Police\nSmokin - Boston\nComplete Control - The Clash\nSweet Leaf - Black Sabbath\nInterstate Love Song - Stone Temple Pilots\nSaints of Los Angeles - Motley Crue\nCalling Dr. Love - Kiss\nSick, Sick, Sick - Queens of the Stone Age\nThe Joker &amp; The Their - Wolfmother\nHitch a Ride - Boston\nAction - Sweet\nAll The Small Things - Blink 182\nThe Perfect Drug - Nine Inch Nails\nWonderwall - Oasis \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40ecd70884deb77a0596d1e4a1cb30e650871c7b","amp;dn":"CUSTOM+%3A+Guitar+Hero+3+%28+Rock+Band+Edition+%29++PROPER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40ecd70884deb77a0596d1e4a1cb30e650871c7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,236,215,8,132,222,183,122,5,150,209,228,161,203,48,230,80,135,28,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
