Covers included.\n\nJames Blunt [born James Hillier Blount, February 22nd 1974 in Tidworth, Wiltshire] is an English singer-songwriter whose debut album, &amp;#039;Back to Bedlam&amp;#039;, and single releases, especially the number one hit &amp;#039;You&amp;#039;re Beautiful&amp;#039;, brought him to fame in 2005. His style is a mix of pop rock and acoustic rock. Along with vocals, James Blunt plays a wide variety of instruments including the piano, guitar, organ, marimba, and mellotron. He is signed to Linda Perry&amp;#039;s American label Custard, and became the first British artist to top the American singles chart in nearly a decade when his song &amp;#039;You&amp;#039;re Beautiful&amp;#039; reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2006. \n\n&amp;#039;All The Lost Souls&amp;#039; is the second studio album from singer-songwriter phenomenon James Blunt. A winning mixture of 70&amp;#039;s influenced pop and acoustic rock, the album is sure to appeal to fans of artists such as Carly Simon and James Taylor. It includes the single &amp;#039;1973&amp;#039;. The music video for the single &amp;#039;1973&amp;#039;, in which a modern-day Blunt strolls among &amp;#039;70s street scenes, reflects the song&amp;#039;s nostalgic tone. It was shot in Los Angeles.\n\nTracks:\n01  1973\n02  One Of The Brightest Stars\n03  I&amp;#039;ll Take Everything\n04  Same Mistake\n05  Carry You Home\n06  Give Me Some Love\n07  I Really Want You\n08  Shine On\n09  Annie\n10  I Can&amp;#039;t Hear The Music\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b47e26593f8c1bed748015ea1b59ff37dafeacc","amp;dn":"James+Blunt+-+All+The+Lost+Souls+%28KRG%29..gadge007+%28repost%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b47e26593f8c1bed748015ea1b59ff37dafeacc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,71,226,101,147,248,193,190,215,72,1,94,161,181,159,243,125,175,234,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
