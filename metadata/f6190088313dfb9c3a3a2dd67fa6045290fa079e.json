Chuck Israels was LaFaro&amp;#039;s replacement, and while he would never take musical charge the way LaFaro did, his supportive presence and solid sound helped make this second edition of the Trio a worthy successor. The 1962 dates produced two albums&amp;#039; worth of material. The previously released MOONBEAMS was lyrical yet somber, while the altogether brighter HOW MY HEART SINGS consistently swings. There is little evidence here of the depressive slump which caused Evans to take off the previous year in response to LaFaro&amp;#039;s death.\n\nJust as on MOONBEAMS, we are introduced here to new Evans originals, additions to a growing and impressive catalog, like &quot;Walking Up&quot; and the exhilarating &quot;Show-Type Tune&quot; in which the pianist puts on his best Bud Powell hat, knocking off line after line of thrillingly executed runs. Add Earl Zindar&amp;#039;s haunting title track, then a nod to Dave Brubeck on the two takes of the latter&amp;#039;s &quot;In Your Own Sweet Way&quot; and HOW MY HEART SINGS stands as the most varied Bill Evans set since his breakthrough EVERYBODY DIGS BILL EVANS.\n\nPersonnel:\nBill Evans (piano); Chuck Israels (bass); Paul Motian (drums).\n\nRecorded at Sound Makers Inc, New York, New York on May 17 &amp; 29 and June 5, 1962. \n\nTrack Listing:\n1.
