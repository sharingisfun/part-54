I just couldn&amp;#039;t choose between these two songs.\nThe Fleshtones album is a must buy! They sound refreshing even though their sound sometimes remind me of the beginning Beatles.\n&quot;What Made Milwaukee Famous&quot; keeps astounding me. Their new album is coming out in March. I&amp;#039;m looking forward to that. If only I could ever get used to their horrible name....\nShelby Lynne has made a tribute album to Dusty Springfield. I never thought I could like something like that, but once I started listening to this album I caught myself humming along and singing along. Reason enough to include a song in this choice.\nThe Drive-by Truckers are swerving between Tom Petty, Neil Young and Lambchop. Their albums are always of high quality.\n&quot;Atlas Sound&quot; has made an album that makes you dream. A thought-full collection of sounds.\nThe Evangelicals have received praise enough. \nAdele is the new hit from England. Saw her on Jools Holland and loved her immediately.\nThe songs from High Places are not new, but have been &quot;gathered&quot; for the first time. They make a great collection.\n\n01 Raheem DeVaughn - Butterflies\n02 Yoav - Club Thing (LaCrate Mix)\n03 Raheem DeVaughn - Friday (Shut The Club Down)\n04 Eli &quot;Paperboy&quot; Reed and the True Loves - Am I Wasting My Time\n05 What Made Milwaukee Famous - Trying To Never Catch Up\n06 What Made Milwaukee Famous - Short On Shields\n07 Sheryl Crow - Now That You&amp;#039;re Gone\n08 Shelby Lynne - Willie And Laura Mae Jones\n09 Drive-by Truckers - You And Your Crystal Meth\n10 Adele - Daydreamer\n11 The Whigs - Sleep Sunshine\n12 The Bird And The Bee - Birthday\n13 Colour Revolt - Naked And Red\n14 Drive-by Truckers - The Man I Shot\n15 The Fleshtones - First Date (Are You Coming On To Me?)\n16 The Fleshtones - Love Yourself\n17 American Music Club - San Francisco\n18 State Bird - The Golden Glowing Mask\n19 The Heavenly States - The Race\n20 Evangelicals - Skeleton Man\n21 Atlas Sound - Cold As Ice\n22 High Places - Sandy Feat (7&quot; version)\n\nHave fun again! Don&amp;#039;t forget to check out mr. Shankly&amp;#039;s Love Child.\nHope to hear from you soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:acfa647d3ade7060afab15a912c992e41150003c","amp;dn":"Bluegamba%5C%27s+Choice+No.+14","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"acfa647d3ade7060afab15a912c992e41150003c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,250,100,125,58,222,112,96,175,171,21,169,18,201,146,228,17,80,0,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
