Dr. Zakir categorically explained the meaning of terrorism. \nQuoting historical facts and figures, he explained how the assumption that \\\\\\&amp;#039;not all Muslims are terrorists but all terrorists are Muslim\\\\\\&amp;#039; was untrue.  Dr. Zakir, who is one of the Muslim world\\\\\\&amp;#039;s leading and most prolific speakers, quoted from the scriptures of other religions and proved that associating killing with Islam is incorrect. \n\\\\\\&amp;#039;We should learn how to turn the tables and convey the real meaning,\\\\\\&amp;#039; said Dr. Zakir, while calling on Muslims to dispel the media\\\\\\&amp;#039;s vilifying of Muslims and the importance of having Muslim television channels and newspapers. \nThe speech was followed by a lively question-and-answer session in which Dr. Zakir dealt with questions from the audience on terrorism and comparative religion. \n---- \nLecture Language: English.
