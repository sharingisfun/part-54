The project&amp;#039;s\noutput has been mostly influenced by music from Ant-Zen, Hymen,\nHands Productions and Ad Noiseam labels. Oldschool EBM and electro\nhave also been described another great influence. Thus the project\nhas often been described as some form of IDM, experimental\nelectronica or contemporary industrial.\n\nSites:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.mikseri.net/artists/mkdelta.64683.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.mikseri.net/artists/mkdelta.64683.php&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/MKDELTA&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.last.fm/music/MKDELTA&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n**************************************************\n***************************\n\nRISA\n\nRI:SA = Dark, atmospheric and experimental rock/metal-influenced\nelectronic music project mixing various darker genres such as Industrial,\nEBM and Dark Ambient.
