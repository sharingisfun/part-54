The film has nested storylines and depicts 8??-like identity crisis theme in autobiographical style. It is also strongly characterised by a series of surrealistic motives linked by chance encounters. The plot&amp;#039;s vague, often detached narrative is a considerable source of humour within the film. It has been lauded as both an achievement of surreal comedy and a work of considerable editorial complexity.\n\nA prominent theme of the movie is duality, as almost all the main characters appear in two forms or roles. Although it is hard to lay one&amp;#039;s finger on the interpretation of this film, it can be said that self actualization is at least a major underlying theme.\n\n[General]\nTitle:                 Takeshi\nData source:           DVD\nDVD title number:      1\nRuntime:               01:47:41\n\n[Video]\nVideo format:          NTSC\nFPS:                   23.976\nSize:                  640 x 352\nVideo bitrate (kbps):  1093\nVideo codec:           xvid4\n2-pass-encoded:        yes\nFast resizing:         no\nDeinterlacer filter:   \nAntialiasing filter:   No antialiasing\n\n[Audio 1]\nDVD audio track id:    0\nLanguage:              ja\nAudio codec:           mp3\nMP3 quality:           0\nChannels:              2\nSample rate:           48000\nAudio bitrate (kbps):  128\nVolume rescaling:      1.692\nAudio filter:          None, volume rescale only\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cd71eae639499783e9c3888e73232828f634da9e","amp;dn":"Takeshi%5C%27s","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cd71eae639499783e9c3888e73232828f634da9e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,113,234,230,57,73,151,131,233,195,136,142,115,35,40,40,246,52,218,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
