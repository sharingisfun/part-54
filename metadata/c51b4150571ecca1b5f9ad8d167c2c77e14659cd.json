In 1997, he stopped this project due personal reasons. The Rorschach Garden was reactivated in 2001, made its first public appearance at the Maschinenfest 2002 in Aachen, Germany. After this, some other live perfomances were held with the help of some of Philipp&amp;#039;s closer friends. Ever since, TRG has grown into a proper band with a steady lineup and a great reputation for live performances. Their musical style has developed into a unique blend of electronic pop music and defies genre limitations. \n\nFormat: CD, Album\nCountry: Germany \nLabel: rorschach prod.\nRelease: June 12, 2008\nTotal Tracks: 17\nStyle: Electronic, Minimal, Electropop, Synthpop\n\n\nTracklisting:\n\n1.   the emperor of rain\n\n2.   dangerous strangers\n\n3.   one year rostock\n\n4.   desperate longing\n\n5.   september\n\n6.   the fallen king\n\n7.   eternal prisoner\n\n8.   falling into the web\n\n9.   complicated spring\n\n10.   again and again\n\n11.   mary&amp;#039;s birthday\n\n12.   accelerate destruction\n\n13.   share\n\n14.   the confession of truth\n\n15.   natural\n\n16.   rain machine\n\n17.   small village (second version)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c51b4150571ecca1b5f9ad8d167c2c77e14659cd","amp;dn":"The+Rorschach+Garden+-+20th+Anniversary+Gift+%5B1994-1996%5D+%282008%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c51b4150571ecca1b5f9ad8d167c2c77e14659cd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,27,65,80,87,30,204,161,181,249,173,141,22,124,44,119,225,70,89,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
