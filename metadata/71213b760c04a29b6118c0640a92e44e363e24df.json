isn&amp;#039;t mid-2008 already? in hindsight\n  there were so many good, original, ground breaking tracks released it would\n  be a shame for most of them to pass your ears by without a listen. \n\n  Yet this mix barely touches on the audio bliss that was unleashed last year,\n  it probably doesn&amp;#039;t even include your favourite tracks.. yet, but it will \n  when you&amp;#039;ve listened to it. :)\n\n  if part-a messed with your mind, this will mess with your soul.. you&amp;#039;ll come\n  out the other side giggling and smiling from the aural waves that have been \n  lapping at your face and body for nearly 6 hours.\n  \n  basically, get downloading, and please seed, and thank you to all those that\n  help seed goa mix 2006, and 2007a for over a year!\n \n  mixed by jrb - goa, psy, and trance tracks from 2007 only if you please!\n\n\n-= info =-\n     mixed by: jrb - please give feedback at thepiratebay.se\n  contact jrb: contact details in the mp3 id3 comments field\n     released: 25/07/2008\n       length: 5h 18m 47s\n  input audio: 96khz, 24bit\n       encode: lame 320bps vbr &quot;extreme&quot;\n\n-= track info =- \n  00 - goa 2007 mixed by jrb - part b.jpg\n  00 - goa 2007 mixed by jrb - part b.m3u\n  00 - goa 2007 mixed by jrb - part b.txt\n  01 - the ataris - tokyo underground\n  02 - prosect - tribalogic (amygdala remix)\n  03 - apocalypse vs systemic - high definition\n  04 - hemi-sync - voice imaging\n  05 - h2o - i dose (alien vs the cat vs quadra)\n  06 - celldweller - frozen (vibe tribe remix)\n  07 - electric t volts - good memories\n  08 - gorillaz - feel good inc (31Hz remix)\n  09 - the unstables - the clone (freakulizer remix)\n  10 - mahamudra - super cherry\n  11 - krunch - pura vida\n  12 - cosmosis - martian blues\n  13 - system failure - antibiotic\n  14 - basic - wicked\n  15 - grenzmedial - treibstoff\n  16 - rubix qube - qubinomix\n  17 - safi connection - d.m.a\n  18 - time lock - templation sensations\n  19 - phanatic vs stereomatic - mexican stud\n  20 - psycoholics - zombie (i feel so numb)\n  21 - spinal chord vs cycle sphere - the final boom (switch rmx)\n  22 - x-noize and domestic - flaming dart (dna remix)\n  23 - basic - one year after\n  24 - i drop - techno raiders 2\n  25 - rabdom l - fire bird\n  26 - zen mechanics - vurt\n  27 - eskimo vs. john phantasm - they&amp;#039;re in trouble now (jrb edit)\n  28 - quantum - nead for lead (dna 2nd edit)\n  29 - zymosis - is that true\n  30 - in panic - ride me baby\n  31 - zen mechanics - cyber spunk (unreleased)\n  32 - ranji - orbiting the earth\n  33 - barak vs shove - take out your brain\n  34 - future prophecy - rock the show (beat hackers remix)\n  35 - beastie boys - fight for your right (gms remix)\n  36 - xerox and illumination - the beast within (unreleased)\n  37 - wrecked machines vs joti sidhu and ptx - nn\n  38 - sub6 vs keren malka - stand with me\n  39 - ultravoice - stonehave\n  40 - intersys - psychoactive\n  41 - x-noize featuring tomer c - live or die (remix)\n  42 - system nipel vs electra - the game\n  43 - sub6 - down and out\n  44 - digipack - electronic outlaw underground\n  45 - electric sheep - toxygen\n  46 - tactic mind - superstitions\n  47 - system nippel - body languaje\n  48 - x-noise - rock it (psycraft remix)\n  49 - sundose - space nirvana\n  50 - blt - anything you want (zen mechanics rmx)\n  51 - wrecked machines vs mack - back in town\n  52 - phanatic vs spade - the party time\n  53 - orvital vision - revolution\n  54 - miditec - quantom physics\n  55 - gms - sweet dreams (live mix)\n  56 - electro sun - new guitar\n  57 - sound field - return to the field\n  58 - the ataris - high definition\n  59 - xolay ax - putra bong remix\n  60 - psychonaut - spacepeople\n  61 - chronos - this is dharma\n  62 - digicult - magic\n  63 - the ataris - weekend has landed\n  64 - shulman - odd reflections\n\nenjoy\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:71213b760c04a29b6118c0640a92e44e363e24df","amp;dn":"goa+2007+mixed+by+jrb+-+part+b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"71213b760c04a29b6118c0640a92e44e363e24df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,33,59,118,12,4,162,155,97,24,192,100,10,146,228,78,54,62,36,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
