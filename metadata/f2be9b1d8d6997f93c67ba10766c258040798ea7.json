The EXI bus has a max       |\n          |  bandwidth of 27mbit. Shoving 100mbit into a bus that    |\n          |  only handles 27mbit does not work.                      |\n          |  GC Sim attempts to limit the bandwidth using timers.    |\n          |  With a good NIC or router, the hardware obeys GC Sim    |\n          |  and it's timer. A bad NIC or router will send packets   |\n          |  when it wants to; not when GC Sim wants. The result     |\n          |  is many missed packets, which show up as X's on the     |\n          |  console.                                                |\n          |  The problem is YOUR HARDWARE!
