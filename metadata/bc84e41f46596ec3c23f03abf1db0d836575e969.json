The prizes? First prize is a Cadillac Eldorado, second prize is a set of steak knives, third prize is the sack! There is no room for losers in this dramatically masculine world; only &quot;closers&quot; will get the good sales leads. There is a lot of pressure to succeed, so a robbery is committed which has unforeseen consequences for all the characters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc84e41f46596ec3c23f03abf1db0d836575e969","amp;dn":"Glengarry+Glen+Ross+%281992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc84e41f46596ec3c23f03abf1db0d836575e969","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,132,228,31,70,89,110,195,194,63,3,171,241,219,13,131,101,117,233,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
