In the 1800s, a boy becomes a man  \n when he ventures through the breech to prove his love for the village        \n beauty by finding a fallen star. The star is no lump of rock, but a maiden,  \n Yvaine, and Tristan, the youth, is not the only one searching for her:       \n three witches, led by Lamia, want her heart to make them young. The sons of  \n the dead king of Stormhold want her because she possesses a ruby that will   \n give one of them title to the throne.                                        \n                                                                              \n\n\n                           Happy Hacker Industries                            \nThis movie should play fine on most DVD/DivX Certified settop\ndvd players.
