Swift and \ncoursing with dark passion.&quot; The Associated Press concurred: &quot;When it comes \nto thriller writers, one name stands well above the crowd?Jack Higgins.&quot;\n\nAnd never have the stakes been higher than in his new novel.\n\nIn the waning days of World War II, Hitler gave his diary to a young aide for \nsafekeeping. Now it&amp;#039;s threatening to resurface, with explosive contents: the \ndetails of a meeting between emissaries of Hitler and Roosevelt to reach an \narmistice and turn their collective efforts against the Soviet Union. The \nAmerican representative: someone very close to none other than the current \npresident, Jake Cazalet. Powerful enemies of Cazalet will do anything to get \ntheir hands on that diary?and it is up to White House operative Blake Johnson \nand his colleague in British intelligence, Sean Dillon, to make sure they don&amp;#039;t....\n\nFilled with hairpin twists and high-tension action, with characters as dark and \nsurprising as any he has created, Bad Company is Higgins working at the \npeak of his powers.\n\n----\n\nSince The Eagle Has Landed?one of the biggest-selling thrillers of all \ntime?every novel Jack Higgins has written, including his most recent works, \nEdge of Danger and Midnight Runner, has become an international bestseller. \nMany of his books have been made into successful movies, among them The \nEagle Has Landed, To Catch a King, On Dangerous Ground, Eye of the Storm, \nand Thunder Point.\n\n----\n\nAn accomplished stage, film, and television actor, Patrick Macnee is probably \nbest known for his performance as John Steed in the long-running hit \ntelevision series The Avengers. He can also be heard on recordings of \nMidnight Runner, Day of Reckoning, and Edge of Danger.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:97511db2ba1d23d8ad9a02dc9a68a03a6afe031f","amp;dn":"Jack+Higgins+-+Bad+Company","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"97511db2ba1d23d8ad9a02dc9a68a03a6afe031f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,81,29,178,186,29,35,216,173,154,2,220,154,104,160,58,106,254,3,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
