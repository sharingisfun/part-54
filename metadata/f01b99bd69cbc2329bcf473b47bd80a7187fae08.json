Before his final battle, King Ambrose, also known as Flycatcher, invited all of the Animal Fables currently trapped on The Farm to move back to their lost Homelands by coming to live in his kingdom of Haven. Boy Blue, determined to fulfill Fly&amp;#039;s last command, brings the news to the Farm ? which starts a debate among the Farm Fables. Will they remain imprisoned at the Farm ? keeping in mind that it&amp;#039;s a very comfortable prison ? or will they journey back to the Homelands to take up residence in Haven?
