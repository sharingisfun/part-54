It focused on the Gotham City Police Department and the difficulties of its officers living and working in Gotham City, home of Batman. It was written by Ed Brubaker and Greg Rucka, with pencils initially by Michael Lark.\n\nGreg Rucka and Ed Brubaker collaborated on the &quot;Officer Down&quot; Batman crossover. They wanted to do a series about the police in Gotham City and finally obtained approval from DC executives. The writers wanted Michael Lark for pencils and waited nearly a year to get him onboard due to scheduling, but used the opportunity to plan out the storylines. They plotted out the new series&amp;#039; elements and decided to script the first story arc together, then split the lengthy cast into two shifts: Rucka would write the GCPD&amp;#039;s day shift storylines, Brubaker would take the night shift, and Lark would pencil them all. Gotham Central&amp;#039;s debut yielded Eisner Award nominations in 2003 for Best New Series, Best Writer-Rucka, Best Writer-Brubaker, and Best Penciller/Inker-Lark[/quote]\n\n\nBIG THANKS to all the scanners involved.\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE BOOK, THEN BUY THE COMICS OR THE TRADES.
