CAT -1x03- PAYMENT OVERDUE   (9/30/1966)\n\nThe agent of a singer is stabbed and Cat is asked to investigate.\n\nStars: Robert Loggia as T. Hewitt Edward Cat\nGuest star: Laura Devon (Jerrie Loren), Don &amp;#039;Red&amp;#039; Barry (Morgan), Dean Harens (Arnie Bliss), Paul Stewart (Constantine Vlakhos)\nWriter: Robert Hamner\n\nIn his role as T. Hewitt Edward Cat (T stands for Tom), Robert Loggia was undoubtedly the coolest hero of the television 60&amp;#039;s. A retired second-story man, Cat undertook missions in which he used his acrobatic skills to their best advantage. NBCadvertised the program as a &quot;high tension adventure series you can really sink your claws into,&quot; and it was just that. I remember this as really cool, noir, slinky, beat. Anybody else remember seeing this show?\n\nBlack and white Film Transfer /AVI File Details\n============================\nT.H.E.
