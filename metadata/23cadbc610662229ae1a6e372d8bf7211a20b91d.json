This is ONLY for those who have downloaded\n\n    our previous CD version.  This upgrade will fix any remaining issues\n\n    during offline/firewalled installation and play.  It will also enable\n\n    online play for cracked servers of CS: Source and enable you to host\n\n    games as well.  The upgraded emulator will also improve gameplay as\n\n    you will read below.\n\n\n    This release is simply the contents of the /VENGEANCE/ directory from\n\n    the DVD, so as you follow the steps, when it says &amp;quot;from the VENGEANCE\n\n    directory on the DVD&amp;quot;, just use the files in this upgrade.\n\n\n    Read the NFO carefully and follow exact instructions. Good luck.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23cadbc610662229ae1a6e372d8bf7211a20b91d","amp;dn":"Half-Life.2.CDVersion.Upgrade-VENGEANCE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23cadbc610662229ae1a6e372d8bf7211a20b91d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,202,219,198,16,102,34,41,174,26,110,55,45,139,247,33,26,32,185,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
