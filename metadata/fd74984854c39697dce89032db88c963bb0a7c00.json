But was the death accidental? A delightful and wholly unexpected murder mystery, British writer/director Sidney Gilliat\\\\\\&amp;#039;s Green for Danger features Trevor Howard and Sally Gray as suspected doctors and Alastair Sim in a marvelous turn as Scotland Yard\\\\\\&amp;#039;s insouciant Inspector Cockrill. A screenwriter who had worked with Hitchcock on such films as The Lady Vanishes and Jamaica Inn, Gilliat slyly upends whodunit conventions with wit and style.\n\n1946, 91 minutes\nBlack and White\nEnglish audio\nEnglish subtitles included\n\n\n(Re-seeding)\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd74984854c39697dce89032db88c963bb0a7c00","amp;dn":"Green+for+Danger+%281946%29+%5BSidney+Gilliat%5D+DVDRip.XviD-PARTiCLE+%28t","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd74984854c39697dce89032db88c963bb0a7c00","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,116,152,72,84,195,150,151,220,232,144,50,219,136,201,99,187,10,124,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
