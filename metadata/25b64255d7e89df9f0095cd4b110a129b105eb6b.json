The songs were released later, on Tinsel-Town Rebellion and You Are What You Is, but in different mixes. The cover was used for Tinsel-Town Rebellion; the old title is still vaguely visible.\n\n01 - Doreen\n02 - Fine Girl\n03 - Easy Meat\n04 - Goblin Girl\n05 - Society Pages\n06 - I&amp;#039;m A Beautiful Guy\n07 - Beauty Knows No Pain\n08 - Charlies Enormous Mouth\n09 - Any Downers\n10 - Conehead\n11 - Teenage Wind (alt mix)\n12 - Fine Girl (alt mix)\n13 - I Don&amp;#039;t Wanna Get Drafted (alt mix)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25b64255d7e89df9f0095cd4b110a129b105eb6b","amp;dn":"Frank+Zappa+Crush+All+Boxes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25b64255d7e89df9f0095cd4b110a129b105eb6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,182,66,85,215,232,157,249,240,9,92,212,177,16,161,41,177,5,235,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
