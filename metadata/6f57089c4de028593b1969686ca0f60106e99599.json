This ~2nd generation copy is a major improvement in picture quality when compared to the previously circulated 3rd/4th generation versions. The washed out colours are replaced by more vivid tones and the rolling lines of interference are (mostly) absent.\nWhilst undeniably a great upgrade, this is still not the Ã¢â‚¬ËœHoly GrailÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ that some had hoped for. Ã¢â‚¬ËœJunglelandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is still cut and the tantalising clips from the show in documentaries such as Ã¢â‚¬ËœGlory DaysÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ demonstrate that there is still plenty of room for further improvement. The bitrate is also rather low (the show is squeezed onto one and a half discs) and so an XP transfer of the same tape would probably be slightly better.\n\nThe DVD also includes some truly fantastic extras. The Phoenix Ã¢â‚¬â„¢78 footage will be familiar to most collectors and here it is presented from no less than four different source. The best of these (#1) appears to be from an original CBS promo tape with a razor-sharp image, but unfortunately a time stamp is superimposed on the bottom of the frame. The other sources are similar to what weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve seen before, except for Ã¢â‚¬ËœPromised LandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ which is in poor quality.\n\nFinally, the pro shot footage of BruceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s guest spot with Southside Johnny at the Agora Club, Cleveland in 1978 is also drawn from a stunningly good new source. The set is wrapped together with some fairly average menu designs.\n\nThis currently represents the best version of this classic show.\n \nDVD 1 \n1. Summertime Blues \n2. Badlands \n3.
