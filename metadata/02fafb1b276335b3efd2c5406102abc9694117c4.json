This one is a rare one, only released as a demo/promo to ship out to\n\t\t\trecordlables and gigplaces.\n\t\t\tThe songs was recorded in spring 2007 by the famous Tommy TÃƒÂ¤gtgren in the even more famous &quot;Studio Abyss&quot;.\n\t\t\tNothing more to say, listen and make up your own thoughts what you think about it.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSpiritus Sancti was formed in 2001 in a small Swedish town called Motala. \n\t\t\tSince then melodic metal has been delivered on two full length records and one demo:\n\t\t\t- &quot;Human Unknown&quot; (Fullhouse records, 2002)\n\t\t\t- &quot;Silence of the Angel Choir&quot; (demo, 2003)\n\t\t\t- &quot;Lead Salvation&quot; (selfreleased, 2006)\n\t\t\t- &quot;Self titled&quot; (demo/promo 2007)\n\t\t\tThe musical direction was at first strongly influed by the Gothenburg metal scene. Today, a few line-up changes later, the band has evolved and is now influed by most kinds of metal. \n\t\t\tIn late 2005 a music video for the song &quot;Downward&quot; was recorded and released on DVD by the band members themselves. \n\t\t\tBeside the recordings a large amount of gigs has been performed over the years with bands like In Flames and Entombed\n\n\t\t\tRippers notes.\n\t\t\tThis release is approved by the band themselves, see it as a gift, and feel free to spread it as much as you want to.\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t+SST+2008+\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t     \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02fafb1b276335b3efd2c5406102abc9694117c4","amp;dn":"Spiritus_Sancti-Self_Titled-MCD-2007-SST","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02fafb1b276335b3efd2c5406102abc9694117c4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,250,251,27,39,99,53,179,239,210,197,64,97,2,171,201,105,65,23,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
