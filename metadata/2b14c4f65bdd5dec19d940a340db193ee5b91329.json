For the rest of the world, we made the DVD ISO image available for download, so you can burn your own! \n\nThe preview DVD contains 5 of the 30 demos on the full DVD, in the same quality, and with all the features (commentary, original and 5.1 channel audio, multiple playback modes, etc.). Plus it has the trailer above and a preview of the Breakpoint featurette. \n\nFor best results, we recommend you view the DVD on a TV set.&quot;\n\n\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b14c4f65bdd5dec19d940a340db193ee5b91329","amp;dn":"mindcandy_2_preview_dvd_pal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b14c4f65bdd5dec19d940a340db193ee5b91329","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,20,196,246,91,221,93,236,25,217,64,163,64,219,25,62,229,185,19,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
