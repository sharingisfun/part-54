This is a great show with the Bombshell Rocks full of energy. If you don't know the Bombshell Rocks you are really missing out on some amazing punk rock, they are the best band to come out of Sweden since Passage 4. I would recommend the album From Here And On(2002) as a good place to start. There early stuff is similar to early Rancid and they just got better. Filming is at my usual high standard, enjoy! \n\nBombshell Rocks-Cas'Rock Edinburgh 12th September 1999 SVCD 40 minutes\n\nThis is in PAL SVCD format and should be burned to CD and it will play in most DVD players. It will fit on 1 80min blank cd-r using nero.\n\nEnjoy bandit999","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2501d8f9d773dfc032f929d7b9bca09eab2e466","amp;dn":"Bombshell+Rocks+Cas%5C%27Rock+Edinburgh+12th+Sept+1999+SVCD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2501d8f9d773dfc032f929d7b9bca09eab2e466","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,80,29,143,157,119,61,252,3,47,146,157,123,155,202,9,234,178,228,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
