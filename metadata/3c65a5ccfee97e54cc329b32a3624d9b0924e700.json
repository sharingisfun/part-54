But this audience recording is being distributed legitimately, as it&amp;#039;s in line with Hawkwind&amp;#039;s Feb 2008 trading policy.\n\nFLAC and MP3 files are both available here. I suggest you select one format or the other, when you&amp;#039;ve loaded up the torrent file.\n\nHAWKWIND - TORQUAY TOWN HALL, Saturday 30 June 1973.  117 mins of music.\n\nFLAC lineage: Low gen tape &gt; CDR &gt; FLAC (TLH)\nMP3 lineage:  Low gen tape &gt; CDR &gt; FLAC (TLH) &gt; MP3 (TLH)\n\nNote: the CD that&amp;#039;s been traded around for years had strange track start points, eg Welcome to the Future started in the middle of the first sentence. The track divisions have been completely redone. Taking the Space Ritual album as a model, track starts include some of the electronic preamble, where possible.\n\nThe 90 seconds of sounds between Brainbox Pollution and Lord of Light now form a track in their own right, as per Electronic No 1 on Space Ritual. This does mean that the artwork doesn&amp;#039;t match the CD, but then that&amp;#039;s often the case, with a Hawkwind CD. The original files didn&amp;#039;t subdivide You Shouldn&amp;#039;t Do That and Seeing It, anyhow.\n\nA short portion is missing from within Brainbox Pollution, 45 minutes into the gig, obviously due to a cassette tape flip. Forty five minutes after that, the end of Time We Left is similarly missing.\n\nQUALITY: 7/10\n\nSound quality is a bit scruffy but quite listenable, and with a reasonable abount of high end.\n\nThe files are also encoded to MP3, for those who don&amp;#039;t have fast connections. There&amp;#039;s no reason why the millions of people without fast broadband, or whose ISP limits their download capacity should be denied the option to hear Hawkwind gigs. The option to upgrade to FLAC later on is there if people want.\n\n\nSETLIST:\n\n01 intro\n02 born to go\n03 down through the night\n04 it&amp;#039;s so easy\n05 the awakening\n06 brainbox pollution\n\n01 effects\n02 lord of light\n03 the watcher\n04 brainstorm\n05 seven by seven\n06 sonic attack\n07 time we left (fades out)\n08 Paranoia\n09 master of the universe\n10 welcome\n11 audience\n12 silver machine\n13 you shouldn&amp;#039;t do that / seeing it as you really are","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c65a5ccfee97e54cc329b32a3624d9b0924e700","amp;dn":"Hawkwind+1973-06-30+Torquay","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c65a5ccfee97e54cc329b32a3624d9b0924e700","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,101,165,204,254,233,126,84,204,50,155,50,163,98,77,155,9,36,231,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
