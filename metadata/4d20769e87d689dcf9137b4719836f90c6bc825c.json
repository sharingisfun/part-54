Neneh Cherry - Homebrew\n\n\nNeneh Cherry doesn&amp;#039;t get into the studio nearly often enough. Three years passed before the British singer/rapper came out with a second album. Thankfully, she more than lived up to the tremendous promise of Raw Like Sushi on the equally magnificent and risk-taking Homebrew. Cherry shows no signs of the dreaded sophomore slump -- everything on the CD is a gem. She triumphs with a seamless and unorthodox blend of hip-hop, R&amp;B, dance music, and pop, and on &quot;Money Love&quot; and &quot;Trout,&quot; the presence of R.E.M.&amp;#039;s Michael Stipe brings rock to the eclectic mix. As humorous as Cherry can be, her reflections on relationships and social issues are often quite pointed. While &quot;Money Love&quot; decries the evils of materialism, the moving &quot;I Ain&amp;#039;t Gone Under Yet&quot; describes an inner-city woman&amp;#039;s determination not to be brought down by the poverty and drugs that surround her. And &quot;Twisted&quot; is about keeping yourself sane in a world gone insane. Unfortunately, Homebrew wasn&amp;#039;t the commercial breakthrough Cherry was more than deserving of.\n\n\n\n01.
