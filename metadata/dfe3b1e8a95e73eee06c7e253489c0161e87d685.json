A crime drama with a nonlinear storyline, the film is known for its rich, eclectic dialogue, its ironic mix of humor and violence, and its host of cinematic and pop culture references. The film was nominated for seven Oscars, including Best Picture; Tarantino and Avary won for Best Original Screenplay. It was also awarded the Palme d\\&amp;#039;Or at the Cannes Film Festival. A major commercial success, it revitalized the career of its leading man, John Travolta, who received an Academy Award nomination, as did costars Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman.\n\nThe film\\&amp;#039;s title refers to the pulp magazines and hardboiled crime novels popular during the mid-20th century, known for their graphic violence and punchy dialogue. Pulp Fiction is self-referential from its opening moments, beginning with a title card that gives two dictionary definitions of \\&quot;pulp\\&quot;. The plot, in keeping with most of Tarantino\\&amp;#039;s other works, is nonlinear. The picture\\&amp;#039;s self-reflexivity, unconventional structure, and extensive use of homage and pastiche have led critics to describe it as a prime example of postmodern film. Pulp Fiction is viewed as the inspiration for many later movies that adopted various elements of its style. The nature of its development, marketing, and distribution and its consequent profitability had a sweeping effect on the field of independent cinema. A cultural watershed, Pulp Fiction\\&amp;#039;s influence has been felt in several other popular mediums.\n\n\nName.........................: Pulp Fiction_1994_dvdrip_ac3_ekolb\nLength.......................: 02h 34m 13s \n\n[Video]\nFormat.......................: NTSC\nOrig.
