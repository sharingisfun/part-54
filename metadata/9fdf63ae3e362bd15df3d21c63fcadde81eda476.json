I&amp;#039;m sure you don&amp;#039;t care, but it has been dubbed from the original tape set and then put onto a DVD. Each episode was then converted to .avi retaining most of the original quality of the tape set (albeit in half the resolution). I realised that my previous release (Dimensions_of_Prophecy_1-5) was completely download un-friendly in that it was 4.36gb and that the user would need to download the whole thing if they only wanted to view, say, episode 3. This has been rectified in this release as you now have the option to download only one episode if you are, for example, wanting only to evaluate the series.\n\nYou will need the DivX codec to view these episodes, so I have included it in the torrent as an option along with a list of all the episodes that is printer-friendly if you choose to make a Dimensions of Prophecy DVD. \n\nGod bless!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fdf63ae3e362bd15df3d21c63fcadde81eda476","amp;dn":"Dimensions+of+Prophecy+by+Kenneth+Cox","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fdf63ae3e362bd15df3d21c63fcadde81eda476","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,223,99,174,62,54,43,209,93,243,210,28,99,252,173,222,129,237,164,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
