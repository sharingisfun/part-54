The trio of Gary Asquith, Danny Briottet and Carl Bonnie debuted on Rhythm King with the 1987 single &quot;Kray Twins,&quot; and moved to Mute one year later for an EP, Biting My Nails. Though Renegade Soundwave spent two years recording material for an album, the release of Soundclash and In Dub within six months vindicated them somewhat. The group's only hit, &quot;Probably a Robbery&quot; (from Soundclash), made the British Top 40 early in 1990, but Bonnie left later that year for a solo career. Asquith and Briottet spent several years in isolation before emerging in 1994 with the &quot;Renegade Soundwave&quot; single and the album How You Doin? After playing their first live date in history during late 1994, the duo released Brixton and The Next Chapter of Dub the following year. The compilation RSW 87-95 emerged in 1996. ~ John Bush, All Music Guide\n\nA two-disc compilation that?s as good a starting point for the newcomer as any, RSW 1987-1995 makes a great case for Renegade Soundwave as the great lost English band of the late eighties and early nineties. Divided up between a vocal and instrumental (mostly) half, each disc is more or less chronological and succeeds on its own ? together it?s nearly unstoppable. Curious to say, but compared to, say, a fair amount of the Britpop hype that burst the year the compilation finishes up, Renegade Soundwave was at once very specifically English ? Gary Asquith?s declamatory speak-sing-MC work never hid its accent for a start ? and very modern as well. Hip-hop and dub was turned into massive industrial beats and stomps like few others could attempt ?Kray Twins? easily rivals and possibly betters a fair amount of mid-eighties Def Jam explosions alone), avoiding the forced modernism of the likes of the Age of Chance for something more cutting and fierce. Besides the basic hits per se ? ?Kray Twins,? ?Biting My Nails,? ?Women Respond to Bass,? ?Thunder,? ?Probably a Robbery? ? there are a fair amount of B-sides and rarer and new remixes as well for the hardcore fan with all four albums (counting The Next Chapter of Dub). Two separate mixes of ?Cocaine Sex? turn up (the ?turbo lust mix? is indeed quite lewd), a fantastic revamp of ?Biting My Nails? from 1990 and one of Leftfield?s best ever efforts, a loping, snarling crawl through ?Renegade Soundwave,? are among the best. The further inclusion of such unfairly less well known tracks as ?The Phantom,? an absolute stormer that seems to have barely aged any, and the John Williams-sampling ?Deadly? is even more for a reason to listen. ~ Ned Raggett, All Music Guide\n\nTrack Listing\n\n# Track # Title # time\n# 1 # Kray Twins # 5:49\n# 2 # Cocaine Sex ( Turbo Lust Mix ) # 6:54\n# 3 # Biting My Nails # 4:09\n# 4 # Lucky Luke # 3:53\n# 5 # Space Gladiator (Satellite of Dub) # 5:15\n# 6 # Murder Music # 2:28\n# 7 # Pocket Porn # 3:44\n# 8 # Can't Get Used to Losing You # 4:29\n# 9 # Probably a Robbery # 3:34\n# 10 # Women Respond to Bass # 5:39\n# 11 # Renegade Soundwave # 3:53\n# 12 # Howyoudoin? # 5:14\n# 13 # Bubbaluba # 3:56\n# 14 # Positive ID # 4:40\n# 15 # Blast 'Em Out # 4:08\n# 16 (2)# Cocaine Sex ( Sub Aqua Overdrive Dub ) # 4:27\n# 17 (2)# The Phantom # 4:44\n# 18 (2)# Ozone Breakdown # 6:32\n# 19 (2)# Biting My Nails (Bassnumb Chapter)# 6:06\n# 20 (2)# Thunder # 5:51\n# 21 (2)# Deadly # 5:00\n# 22 (2)# Transworld Siren # 5:58\n# 23 (2)# Black Eye Boy # 6:17\n# 24 (2)# Renegade Soundwave ( Leftfield Remix ) # 7:50\n# 25 (2)# Last Freedom Fighter ( Dub ) # 6:49\n# 26 (2)# The Renegade Priest # 5:55\n# 27 (2)# Positive Mindscape # 6:14\n# 28 (2)# Blastik # 15:44\n\nCredits\n\n* Daniel Mille * Mixing\n* Steve Osborne * Mixing\n* Mark &quot;Spike&quot; engineer\n* Danny Briottet * Liner Notes\n* Julian Briottet * Engineer, Mixing\n* George Holt * Engineer, Mixing\n* Pascale FeuillÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©e * Vocals\n* Tim Davies * Engineer, Mixing\n* Rico Conning * Engineer, Mixing\n* Flood * Producer\n* Paul Kendall * Vocals, Engineer, Mixing, Producer\n* Leftfield * Producer, Remastering, Remixing\n* Renegade Soundwave * Producer, Mixing, Main Performer &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://workittothebone.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://workittothebone.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee2ea3f1f8969c8847e5aee8e7fcf35975f36e2c","amp;dn":"Renegade+Soundwave+RSW+87-95+++mp3+320kbs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee2ea3f1f8969c8847e5aee8e7fcf35975f36e2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,46,163,241,248,150,156,136,71,229,174,232,231,252,243,89,117,243,110,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
