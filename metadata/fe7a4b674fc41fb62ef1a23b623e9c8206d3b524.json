They were managed by former Pet Shop Boys manager Tom Watkins. In fact the songs on the first album were written by their producer Nicky Graham working under the name &quot;The Brothers&quot; to give the impression that the Goss brothers were the actual writers of the early hits. The Goss brothers took over composing duties thereafter.\n\n\n\n\n\n.ooOO ROSA MANNEN 2008 OOoo.\n\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe7a4b674fc41fb62ef1a23b623e9c8206d3b524","amp;dn":"Bros+-+When+Will+I+Be+Famous+%28US+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe7a4b674fc41fb62ef1a23b623e9c8206d3b524","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,122,75,103,79,196,31,182,46,241,162,59,98,62,156,130,6,211,181,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
