Three of the songs on Eldorado turned up on that record (including &quot;Don't Cry&quot; in a different version), but &quot;Cocaine Eyes&quot; and &quot;Heavy Love&quot; did not, making this disc a necessary purchase for Young completists.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd5a49af21150157a54f302e1fc14f26b388a382","amp;dn":"Neil+Young+%281989%29+Eldorado+%28%40192%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd5a49af21150157a54f302e1fc14f26b388a382","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,90,73,175,33,21,1,87,165,79,48,46,31,193,79,38,179,136,163,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
