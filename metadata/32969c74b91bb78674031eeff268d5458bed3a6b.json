Disc 1 includes 17 of De/Vision&amp;#039;s best singles and album tracks from 1998&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Monosex&amp;#039; album to 2006&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Subkutan&amp;#039;. Disc 2 contains 14 remixes of tracks during the same time period.\n\nNow to the review:\n\nI&amp;#039;ve been anticipating this release for a long time, and it does not disappoint. Disc 1 is an outstanding collection which shows the broad range of the band&amp;#039;s talents. It truly highlights De/Vision&amp;#039;s versatility and incredible talent as songwriters and musicians.\n\nWhether you like dancefloor killers like &quot;The End&quot;, &quot;Drifting Sideways&quot; or the ever-popular &quot;We Fly... Tonight&quot;, or prefer the infectious mid-tempo pop songs such as &quot;I&amp;#039;m Not Dreaming of You&quot;, &quot;Miss You More&quot;, and &quot;Still Unknown&quot;, or love tender ballads like &quot;Unputdownable&quot; or &quot;Aimee&quot;, or perhaps you can&amp;#039;t get enough of the energetic and dirty &quot;Foreigner&quot;, &quot;Strange Affection&quot;, or &quot;Freedom&quot;, it&amp;#039;s all here... almost.\n\nCertain glaring omissions include &quot;New Drug&quot; from &amp;#039;Monosex&amp;#039; and &quot;Turn Me On&quot; from &amp;#039;6 Feet Underground.&amp;#039; However, there is so much good stuff here, that it really shouldn&amp;#039;t matter.\n\nA couple unexpected tracks included are &quot;The Day&amp;#039;s Not Done&quot; from &amp;#039;Devolution&amp;#039; and &quot;6 Feet Underground&quot;. While I think the former track could have been omitted in favor of a better song, the inclusion of the latter, 6FU is brilliant. The band included a song which typically would lack &quot;pop&quot;-appeal, but which exposes the full breadth of the their repertoire. And I love it.\n\nOne new track can be found on disc one called &quot;Love Will Find A Way&quot;. Add it to your list of dancefloor killers listed above. It is truly amazing, and shows that De/Vision are still capable of creating an uptempo club song.\n\nWhile Disc 1 is awesome and generally comprehensive in scope, Disc 2 is the real reason I bought this. Since De/Vision no longer releases maxi-singles to the general public, remixes of their more current songs are difficult to come by.\n\nThe remixes are outstanding with one exception. I don&amp;#039;t care for The mix of &quot;The Day&amp;#039;s Not Done,&quot; which isn&amp;#039;t one of their better songs anyway.\n\nHighlights include Andrew Sega&amp;#039;s mix of &quot;Still Unkown&quot; (Sega does a nice job of turning a good pop track into a danceable club hit), Mesh&amp;#039;s take on &quot;Digital Dream&quot;, the extended club version of &quot;The End&quot; (which really isn&amp;#039;t much different than the original), &quot;Miss You More&quot; by Telekommander, T.O.Y.&amp;#039;s remix of &quot;Drifting Sideways&quot;, and Wave In Head&amp;#039;s interpretation of &quot;Turn Me On.&quot;\n\nBut the remixes I am most impressed with are &quot;Sadness&quot;(The Sad Death of Mix), and &quot;Star-Crossed Lovers&quot;(In A Black Hole Mix). Both songs are among my very favorites in their album forms, but these remixes are tremendous. &quot;Sadness&quot; contains some of the coolest vocal distortion I&amp;#039;ve ever heard, without destroying the voice of course. &quot;Star-Crossed Lovers&quot; is sped up and could easily be heard in a club.\n\nThis is a terrific buy for the price. In fact I purchased two, one for myself, and another for a friend who has never heard De/Vision before. That is how confident I am that anyone with any good taste in music, will like this release.\n\n(Review by Wayneman from Amazon.com)\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32969c74b91bb78674031eeff268d5458bed3a6b","amp;dn":"De%2FVision+-+Best+of...+%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32969c74b91bb78674031eeff268d5458bed3a6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,150,156,116,185,27,183,134,116,3,30,239,242,104,213,69,139,237,58,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
