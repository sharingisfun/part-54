While some tracks are the straight-up covers typical of tribute albums, die-hard Doors fans have greater reasons to pay attention. The surviving band members appear on several tracks -- sometimes as a backing unit, sometimes as individual guest collaborators -- with frequently vital-sounding results. Echoing the Fatboy Slim &amp;quot;Bird Of Prey&amp;quot; single (coincidence that this was released around the same time?), producer Sall also incorporates sampled Morrison vocals, usually over atmospheric, electronic-tinged backing tracks; this tactic also produces beyond-the-grave Morrison duets with John Lee Hooker and William S. Burroughs. However -- perhaps logically -- it's the band performances that have the most life to them, especially those involving the Stone Temple Pilots and Ian Astbury. Even though &amp;quot;Stoned Immaculate&amp;quot; occasionally suffers from typical tribute-album unevenness, it's overall a fitting testament to the Doors' legacy. ~ Steve Huey, All Music Guide \n\nMP3 VBR\nAudiograbber 1.82\nLAME 3.93","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02cd8a8d090fb622a73a0bdab57b370bdc8490aa","amp;dn":"Stoned+Immaculate+-+The+Music+of+The+Doors+%282000%29+%2ADoors+Tribute","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02cd8a8d090fb622a73a0bdab57b370bdc8490aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,205,138,141,9,15,182,34,167,58,11,218,181,123,55,11,220,132,144,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
