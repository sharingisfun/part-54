This is a fair-to-middling quality VHS-AVI transfer with good audio.  There is a bit of tracking noise on the bottom of the picture throughout and about a minute of tracking noise covering the whole screen around halfway through.  However, it is the only copy I have ever found on BitTorrent, and it made my wife very happy.\n\nEnglish, no subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a57c60bda62e7415323a218ccf6803c4b31923d","amp;dn":"PiratesOfPenzanceAVI-1983","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a57c60bda62e7415323a218ccf6803c4b31923d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,87,198,11,218,98,231,65,83,35,162,24,204,246,128,60,75,49,146,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
