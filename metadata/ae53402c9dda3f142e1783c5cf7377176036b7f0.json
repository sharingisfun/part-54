Not all of them are actually tools you?ll use when exploring the world of torrents . . . such as Google Talk, but I thought that a lightweight Chat Client from the greatest company in the world should be tacked on. \n\nTools such as Alzip, uTorrent, Daemon Tools, and VLC(Videolan) will prove most valuable when you journey through the world or torrents, and learning to use them to their best will prove very useful. \n\nWorld Best Torrent Search Engines\n\n-\n-\twww.thepiratebay.se\n-\n\nLearn them well, because not all sites are trustworthy. Happy Hunting ! ! !
