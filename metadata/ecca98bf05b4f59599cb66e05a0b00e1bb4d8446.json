But a fire breaks out in the pressurized capsule of Apollo 1, resulting in the deaths of Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chaffee. But NASA&amp;#039;s astronauts and engineers turn tragedy into triumph with the first manned launch of the formidable Saturn V rocket, lifting three astronauts into deep space for the first time. Two missions later and NASA is ready to land men on the moon in the ultimate test of America&amp;#039;s spacefaring vision.\n\nNow that NASA has mastered the lunar round trip, they want to explore more of the moon&amp;#039;s mysteries. With Apollo 13, they face their biggest crisis in space -- returning a damaged spacecraft back safely to earth. Undaunted, NASA launches more moon missions and a new lunar rover that allows wide-ranging lunar surface expiditions. Apollo 17 is the longest moon mission and the last time man would set foot on the moon for generations. In a new phase of the space program, NASA converts an unused Saturn V rocket into Skylab, America&amp;#039;s first space-station. But by the time it reaches orbit it&amp;#039;s badly damaged. For the first time, astronauts will have to work outside the spaceship to save the space-station.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ecca98bf05b4f59599cb66e05a0b00e1bb4d8446","amp;dn":"When+We+Left+Earth+-+Part+2.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ecca98bf05b4f59599cb66e05a0b00e1bb4d8446","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,202,152,191,5,180,245,149,153,203,102,224,90,11,0,225,187,77,132,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
