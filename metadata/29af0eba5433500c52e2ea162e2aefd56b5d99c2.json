Out Of Space\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nTechnical:\nI stitched two files into one because the audio/video of the original file was not lip-synchronized. One file was the video of which the audio file was bad. The other file was a mp3 of the same show, which had way better quality than the audio part of the video file.\n\nFirst I had to find software which could combine the two files into one, with which I could copy, paste, cut etc the good audio file in order to get a lip-synch video. Second was that I had to do all work myself in my few spare time, it took about 5 months to complete the file.\n___________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThanks:\nTo theprodigy.nl for making the original two files available\nTo Sony for their excellent product Sony Sound Forge\nMy girlfriend for being patient with me\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29af0eba5433500c52e2ea162e2aefd56b5d99c2","amp;dn":"Prodigy+-+Live+%40+Lowlands+August+19th%2C+2005+%28Stitched%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29af0eba5433500c52e2ea162e2aefd56b5d99c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,175,14,186,84,51,80,12,82,226,234,22,46,42,239,213,107,93,153,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
