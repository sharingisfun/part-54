And he has given Basra&amp;#039;s militias until Saturday morning to lay down their weapons.\n \nThis battle for Basra is seen as key to breaking up the lucrative networks of smuggled drugs, oil and guns that run through the strategic southern city.\n \nBut can Iraq&amp;#039;s security forces break the militias&amp;#039; stranglehold on Basra once and for all?\n \nDoes this spell a new dawn for Iraq, or are we likely to witness a rise in sectarian violence?\n\nInside Story investigates\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/866E05AA-4036-4B09-97C1-E8C794C07049.htm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/866E05AA-4036-4B09-97C1-E8C794C07049.htm&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCap: shunster ex- YouTube:as flv\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b04fb1df2a336eb319ddd4152c63609c3e074718","amp;dn":"Inside+Story%3A+Iraq%5C%27s+Militias%2C+The+Battle+for+Basra+2008.03.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b04fb1df2a336eb319ddd4152c63609c3e074718","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,79,177,223,42,51,110,179,25,221,212,21,44,99,96,156,62,7,71,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
