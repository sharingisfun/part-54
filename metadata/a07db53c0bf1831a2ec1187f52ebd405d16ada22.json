It contains English and Japanese audio with English subtitles.\n\nDirectors: Keiichi Sugiyama\nFormat: Animated, Color, DVD-Video, Subtitled, NTSC\nLanguage: English, Japanese\nSubtitles: English\nAspect Ratio: 1.33:1\nRating: Unrated \nStudio: Funimation Prod\nDVD Release Date: February 20, 2007\nRun Time: 90 minutes\n\nI decided to put the full disk image up because when trying to rip just the movie, I got Japanese text at the intro and at the end.  If anyone can rip it so that the English text is ripped as it appears in the movie please do and point to it in the comments.  I will gladly seed your torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a07db53c0bf1831a2ec1187f52ebd405d16ada22","amp;dn":"Origin%3A+Spirits+of+the+Past+FULL+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a07db53c0bf1831a2ec1187f52ebd405d16ada22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,125,181,60,11,241,131,26,46,193,24,127,82,235,212,5,209,106,218,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
