Before long, the travellers are captured and taken into the depths of the Earth, where they find a hidden civilisation - the lost city of Atlantis.\n\nThe Atlanteans worship a goddess named Amdo and use Fish People - men and women operated upon so that they can breathe under the sea - to farm the plankton-based food on which they survive. A deranged scientist, Professor Zaroff, has convinced them that he can raise their city from the sea, but actually he plans to drain the ocean into the Earth&amp;#039;s molten core, so that the resultant superheated steam will cause the planet to explode.\n\nThe travellers meet up with two shipwreck survivors, Sean and Jacko, who manage to persuade the Fish People to rebel and stop work. The Doctor eventually manages to foil Zaroff&amp;#039;s plan, but only by breaking down the sea walls and flooding the city. Zaroff drowns, but everyone else escapes.\n\n\n\nBBC Production Details\n\nProduction Code:                     GG\nOriginal Transmission (UK):      Saturday 14 January 1967 - Saturday 04 February 1967\nSeason:                                    4\nNumber of Episodes:                4\nWriter:                                      Geoffrey Orme\nProducer:                                  Innes Lloyd\nDirector:                                    Julia Smith\n\n\nLoose Cannon Production Details\n\nProduction Release Date:         August 2005\nEpisode(s) Reconstructed:       Episodes 1,2,4\nSource Material:                       John Cura&amp;#039;s telesnaps\n                                                Audio recorded by Graham Strong\n                                                Surviving clips\n                                                Other authentic pictures\n                                                Composite pictures\n                                                Pictures from other stories / sources\n                                                Specially Created Material\n\n\n\nBonus Material\n\n\nCelebrity Introduction\n\nAnother Furst for Loose Cannon (as Rose would say, &quot;I can&amp;#039;t believe you just said that&quot; - Ed). We were absolutely thrilled when retired actor Joseph Furst, who played Professor Zaroff in the original story, agreed to record an introduction to the Underwater Menace reconstruction. Joseph now lives abroad and this celebrity introduction is the first one to be filmed in Australia.\n\n\nProduction Featurette\n\nThe first part of the introduction is a short &amp;#039;mini-documentary&amp;#039; which gives some details behind the production history of the Underwater Menace. This is narrated by Joseph Furst.\n\n\n \n\nCelebrity Interview\n\nAlso included on the tape is an interview with Joseph Furst. Joseph talks to Loose Cannon about numerous subjects including some of his early career, recollections of filming Underwater Menace and his memorable acting experiences. Thanks to our friends &amp;#039;down under&amp;#039;, Dwayne Bunney and Dallas Jones, for their help with the interview.\n\n\n\n=== File Information ===\nFile Name:   Doctor Who - 032 - The Underwater Menace  - Episode 1 to 4\nLoose Cannon DVD iso\nDuration:      01.59.15\n\n=== Video Information ===\nDVD ISO file ready to burn to DVD.\nthis is a HQ PAL DVD.\nit should play in any DVD player.\n720x576\n\n=== Audio Information ===\nit has MPEG audio\n\nTHIS IS FROM THE DIGITAL SOURCE ITSELF NO AVI CONVERSION NO IDEA HOW IT GOT ON THE INTERNET but theres only one way it could have but am not saying, I downloaded this in 2006 I only wish there was more and you can really tell the difference between VHS rip and this.
