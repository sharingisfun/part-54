Each episode is non-stop animated fun. The show is like the movies except less violent because it is aimed at kids who watch the USA network. It follows the adventures of young Quentin MacLeod who I guess is somehow related to Duncan MacLeod in some way, but I don&amp;#039;t know how. Just like in the movies, MacLeod always manages to save the day except this time there isn&amp;#039;t any bloodshed. Sure, it mocks the violence of the movies, but that is why it&amp;#039;s so enjoyable. It&amp;#039;s good fun without too much violence and no blood or gore. Too bad it was canceled so quickly, it was one of the best shows during the 1994-1995 TV season.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a91a1c6fe842cf73ff5eaa47dad68c88fa39ddd1","amp;dn":"Highlander+-+The+Animated+Series+Season+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a91a1c6fe842cf73ff5eaa47dad68c88fa39ddd1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,26,28,111,232,66,207,115,255,94,170,71,218,214,140,136,250,57,221,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
