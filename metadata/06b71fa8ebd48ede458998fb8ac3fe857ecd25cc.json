It is really fast because it doesn&amp;#039;t have a lot of the crap that usually bogs down Windows like Internet Explorer. I really don&amp;#039;t have that great of a description for this because this is not an official M*croso*t product. I tested this and it works really fast. It&amp;#039;s not a good idea to install it alongside an official copy of Windows XP. No serial is required for the install and the OS doesn&amp;#039;t need to be activated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06b71fa8ebd48ede458998fb8ac3fe857ecd25cc","amp;dn":"Windows+XP+gamers+Edition-DX10","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06b71fa8ebd48ede458998fb8ac3fe857ecd25cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,183,31,168,235,212,142,222,69,137,152,251,138,195,254,133,126,205,37,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
