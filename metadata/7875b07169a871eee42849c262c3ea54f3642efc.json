This one was by Dux Ducis entitled &quot;All The Flesh&quot;. It turns out to be a nice listen. Artwork will be posted as soon as available. The tracks are slightly longer or shorter than the original Dux Ducis had posted, but the concept is still intact and the change is unnoticeable. So get ready to enjoy &quot;All The Flesh&quot;.\n\nTracks:\n\n1. The New Flesh (thingsfallingapart.com version) (aka The New Flesh version a) [1:19]\n2. The New Flesh (Edit) [1:31]\n3. Complications of the Flesh [6:36]\n4. Untitled (from thingsfallingapart.com) (aka The New Flesh version b) [1:07]\n5.
