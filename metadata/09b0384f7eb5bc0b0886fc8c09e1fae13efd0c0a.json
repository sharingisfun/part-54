Maybe not very, but high-quality, rootsy rocky R&amp;amp;B doesn't need to be. It just has to be good and sincere. This is.\nOnly seven songs, but enough variation on the album. And all songs are more than 'okay'.\nA short album, but fortunately there's a 'repeat-button'on my CD player.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09b0384f7eb5bc0b0886fc8c09e1fae13efd0c0a","amp;dn":"Detroit+Cobras+-+Seven+Eeasy+Pieces","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09b0384f7eb5bc0b0886fc8c09e1fae13efd0c0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,176,56,79,126,181,188,11,8,134,252,140,9,225,250,225,62,253,12,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
