The CD-Audio tracks are enhanced version of the in game tracks:\n- &quot;A Pleasantly Understated Credit Sequence&quot; has some instruments added, some drums are replaced with non-Sound Canvas versions. The mix is different and I wasn&amp;#039;t quite happy with it, as the drums lack much power compared to the MIDI version, but I still wanted the extra instruments on the soundtrack CD. Thus I helped the drums a bit with some small-band expansion.\n- &quot;Doug, The Moleman&quot; is slightly longer and also has some instruments replaced.\n- &quot;King Of The Creatures&quot; is a full CD quality version of the 22050 Hz mono version from monster.sou.\n- &quot;Bigfoot Shuffle&quot; has ambient noise added and is partially played in a different key for some reason. It is also shortened a bit, eventhough the ambient noise is going on for quite a while. I mixed the missing part from the MIDI version right into the ambient noise, which works quite well.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:243a55e2b391e51b38f29b6ad3133c83c0e6f89d","amp;dn":"Sam+and+Max+soundtrack+%5Bhigh+quality+Sound+Canvas+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"243a55e2b391e51b38f29b6ad3133c83c0e6f89d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,58,85,226,179,145,229,27,56,242,155,106,211,19,60,131,192,230,248,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
