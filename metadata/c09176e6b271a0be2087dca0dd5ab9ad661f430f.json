Most stories were set in World War II, with some based on other conflicts.\n\nIn 1974, in response to the success of the D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd war comic Warlord, IPC hired freelance writers Pat Mills and John Wagner to develop a rival title. Mills and Wagner brought in fellow freelancer Gerry Finley-Day to help develop stories. When the title proved a success, Mills went on to create Action and 2000 AD, while Wagner was asked to revive Valiant. The attempts to breathe new life into Valiant were unsuccessful, and it was merged with Battle in October 1976.[1] For some time afterwards the merged comic was entitled Battle Picture Weekly and Valiant. Action also merged with Battle on 19 November 1977, the resulting comic being named Battle Action. In 1982 the comic was retitled again, to Battle.\n\nA notable feature of the comic, suited to its era of circulation, was its letters page with readers sending in stories of their fathers&amp;#039; and grandfathers&amp;#039; exploits during the Great War and WWII, often in an effort to win a nominal &amp;#039;star letter&amp;#039; prize.\n\nSee also:\n\nComicsuk.co.uk\nBest of Battle at sevenpennynightmare.co.uk\n\n\nCategory:\tComics\nSize:\t664.48 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\nFile Name \tSize\nBattle Action Holiday Special 1981 (The Baron).cbr \t43.34 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1975.cbr \t38.26 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1976.cbr \t33.60 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1977.cbr \t32.82 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1978.cbr \t28.69 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1979.cbr \t34.06 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1980.cbr \t33.01 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1982.cbr \t48.90 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1983.cbr \t44.92 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1984.cbr \t45.99 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1985.cbr \t42.45 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1987.cbr \t46.00 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1988.cbr \t41.23 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1989.cbr \t37.02 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1990.cbr \t35.42 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly - Summer Special 1991.cbr \t34.53 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly Holiday Special 1986.cbr \t44.21 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c09176e6b271a0be2087dca0dd5ab9ad661f430f","amp;dn":"Battle+Specials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c09176e6b271a0be2087dca0dd5ab9ad661f430f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,145,118,230,178,113,160,190,32,135,220,160,221,90,185,173,102,31,67,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
