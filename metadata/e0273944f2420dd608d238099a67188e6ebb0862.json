However, the reality is\nthat the former Light Brigade leader produced and directed Terry Snyder's loose\naggregate of instrumentalists known as the Command All-Stars. What sets the\nnumerous volumes of Provocative Percussion (1958) and Persuasive Percussion\n(1959) -- as well as countless spin-offs -- apart from the plethora of other easy\nlistening combos was Light's innovative use of technology. Most notably, experiments\nin extreme stereo mixing that took advantage of what was then considered an\naudiophile-only novelty. He also became one of the pioneers to document audio on 35\nmillimeter film rather than magnetic-based audio tape. Not only did this allow for a\nbroader range of frequencies to be captured, it greatly increased the stability of the\nplayback. Undoubtedly, that is one reason the fidelity of his analog masters sound\nbetter and more animated than those made nearly a half-century later. This title,\nPersuasive Percussion (1959), was the first in the series and is often cited with\nhelping usher in the ultra-cool space-age pop genre, which became visually\nrecognizable thanks to John Lautner's unique Googie-inspired abstract artwork that\ngraced a majority of the gatefold LP jackets. The vibe within the grooves is equally as\npostmodern (at least in 1950) with highly stylized interpretations of a dozen\nstandards. Such thematic variations sonically depict the era with swelling Hammond\norgan solos and arrangements replete with bongos, maracas, as well as all other\ndimensions of hand percussion. These are balanced against the understated jazzy\nmelody lines from Dick Hyman (keyboards) and Tony Motolla (guitar). Sure,\nincisive [read: cynical] modern ear may dismiss these renderings of &amp;quot;Miserlou,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I\nSurrender, Dear,&amp;quot; and the Tiki-informed version of &amp;quot;TabÃƒâ‚¬&amp;quot; as retro kitsch. Sadly, that\nwould be missing the point entirely. In 1995, Persuasive Percussion [Compilation]\nwas issued on CD with six additional sides from Persuasive Percussion, Vol. 2 (1960).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0273944f2420dd608d238099a67188e6ebb0862","amp;dn":"Enoch+Light+-+Persuasive+Percussion+%28Exotica-1959%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0273944f2420dd608d238099a67188e6ebb0862","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,39,57,68,242,66,13,214,8,210,56,9,154,103,24,142,110,187,8,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
