Well there&amp;#039;s No-One with 100% complete zip file. Everyone on the torrent is at 99.8% because the initial seeder probably thought it would be funny to leave everyone at 99.8%. It is corrupt and you probably can&amp;#039;t extract it. I fixed the Zip and now here is the result. Believe it or not, the corrupted file in the Zip was Pacman.jpg (lol).\n\nSo... you won&amp;#039;t have that, but if you want you can put your own pacman photo in I guess (Under *\\Fixed_Zip_Games_RO\\Games_RO\\AAAAA). I don&amp;#039;t know whether or not that missing file will cause problems in installation and/or gameplay, but whatever, I&amp;#039;m sure since you can use torrent you can fix that if the problem arises... A.K.A. putting a picture into a folder, rofl.\n\nSecond, the Ipod firmware was improperly compressed into a zip, so if you did manage to download and extract the zip, it was uninstallable anyway. Ta-da. Well I fixed that too.\n\nAlso, it is much more compressed thatn the original, using he much better &quot;7-Zip&quot; Format, so it should download much faster. The Extraction program for this can be found at 7-Zip.org =)\n\nI wanted to play, and a Corrupt Zip wasn&amp;#039;t my idea of a fun time. So I fixed it, and I thought I should share my fix.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:df902bc6fb43970c78a001d0e466312bb44999f5","amp;dn":"All+20+iPod+Games+-+Corrupt+Zip+Fixed+by+wzaerreazw.7z","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"df902bc6fb43970c78a001d0e466312bb44999f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,144,43,198,251,67,151,12,120,160,1,208,228,102,49,43,180,73,153,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
