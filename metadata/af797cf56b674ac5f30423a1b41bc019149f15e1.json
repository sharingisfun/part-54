What this ban means in human terms is brought home with unflinching force by the cases Seelye shows us. \n\nWe meet pregnant women with health problems that force them into an appalling choice: to endanger their lives by continuing with their pregnancy, or risk jail by seeking an illegal abortion. As usual, Unreported World gives us plenty to think about.\n\n(As in other parts of the 3rd World such as Africa and the Philippines, the Roman Catholic uses unbridled political power to dominate these weak societies. It limits birth control programs so that innocent people are murdered by HIV and millions suffer the slow death of starvation from overpopulation.
