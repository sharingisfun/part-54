Some of the stuff he pulled off in the series is mindblowing. He worked out where a penalty-shooter will kick the ball into a goal, what a psychiatrist is thinking before he thinks it, and even drawn an elaborate building entirely from memory. The series also includes celebrities such as Stephen Fry and Martin Kemp.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b57f7b5fa293e156d6ec8eb7a2894d6dc898f531","amp;dn":"Derren+Brown+-+Trick+Of+The+Mind+%5B6+part+series%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b57f7b5fa293e156d6ec8eb7a2894d6dc898f531","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,127,123,95,162,147,225,86,214,236,142,183,162,137,77,109,200,152,245,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
