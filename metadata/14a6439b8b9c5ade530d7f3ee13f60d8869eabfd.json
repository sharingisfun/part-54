Electric blues with a tone all his own, even National Steel Dobro with his favourite glass bottle slide. \n\nThere aren&amp;#039;t many guitarists these days that you can recognise after hearing just a couple of notes, but Van Wilks is one of them. \n\nFellow Texan guitarist Eric Johnson joins Van for a guest spot on Vanatized - an upbeat intrumental that puts Van alongside the greats where he belongs.\n \nVan&amp;#039;s guitar playing should be heard by anyone into any style of blues, he has a genuine passion, and unique tone, that can be heard all over Koko&amp;#039;s Hideaway. You will not be disappointed.\n\nCover arts included.\n \nEnjoy, please comment and seed! \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:14a6439b8b9c5ade530d7f3ee13f60d8869eabfd","amp;dn":"Blues+-+Van+Wilks+-+Koko%5C%27s+Hideaway+-+1999","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"14a6439b8b9c5ade530d7f3ee13f60d8869eabfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,166,67,155,139,156,90,222,83,13,127,62,225,63,96,216,134,158,171,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
