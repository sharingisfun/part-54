In addition, Canton is convulsed by a struggle between the local representatives of the Chinese government and Europeans who want to control China, and Wong ends up in the middle of this fight. He is again assisted by young Chung, and again must protect Aunt Yee, his young, Westernized aunt-by-adoption with whom Wong has fallen in love. He also ends up with schoolful of small children to protect! The climactic shipboard fight sequences are classic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a71b2cc5c9f4236d98007eb5f9a565c2bd167d8","amp;dn":"Once+Upon+a+Time+in+China+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a71b2cc5c9f4236d98007eb5f9a565c2bd167d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,113,178,204,92,159,66,54,217,128,7,235,95,154,86,92,43,209,103,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
