Besides the hot guitar skills on offer here, it was the distinctive vocals of Corky Jones that I enjoyed the most. As another reviewer put it, a mix of Allman Brothers and Stevie Ray Vaughan was spot on. However, I am sure that reviewer will agree with me that the comparison to S R V is NOT the sound of the guitar but the sound of vocal. I much prefer Corkys tones as they are not so nasal. My two favourite tunes are \\&quot;Ease on my way\\&quot; (For the vocals) and \\&quot;Mornin\\&quot; (For the guitar - You need to check out the extended version of this on the Live and Screaming CD). I also enjoyed \\&quot;Time is gonna bring us a change\\&quot; and the softer \\&quot;With you\\&quot;, not to mention a great rendition of the Buddy Miles Tune \\&quot;Them Changes\\&quot; Popularised by Jimi Hendrix. I dont know if this band are still playing, but if they are, I would jump at the chance of seeing them, more so than say, Government Mule or the Allmans for example.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cda8740e887068fae20a7316921a0c0cb796da5","amp;dn":"Allgood+Ride+The+Bee+++320+kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cda8740e887068fae20a7316921a0c0cb796da5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,218,135,64,232,135,6,143,174,32,167,49,105,33,160,192,203,121,109,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
