He came to Montreal, Canada at the end of World War II. \n\nAs a &amp;#039;Humanist leader&amp;#039; he promoted the idea that people had a right to control their own sexuality and reproduction, without interference by the state. \n\nThroughout his career he has faced several trials and was acquitted each time by a jury. \n\nMorgentaler now operates six clinics in Canada providing care for women in need of abortions and contraceptive services.\n\nInterviewed by Evan Solomon\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/sunday/2008/01/012708_5.html,&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cbc.ca/sunday/2008/01/012708_5.html,&lt;/a&gt; wmv available.\n\nSoS = http://www.sonofshun.com/forums\n\nshunster\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23328af7de12bfff358136159cb3934e185f3a82","amp;dn":"Morgentaler%5C%27s+Abortion+Legacy+%28CBC+Sunday%29+2008+01+27+SoS+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23328af7de12bfff358136159cb3934e185f3a82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,50,138,247,222,18,191,255,53,129,54,21,156,179,147,78,24,95,58,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
