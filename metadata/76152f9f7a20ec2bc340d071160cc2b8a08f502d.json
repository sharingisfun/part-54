This folder is placed in your root directory where you have your game installed right next to the other folders such as Docs, main, miles and so on. It should look something like this:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Activision\\Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare\\usermaps\n\nInside the usermaps folder each map should have it&amp;#039;s own folder that&amp;#039;s titled the name of the map. So it should look something like this:\n\nC:\\Program Files\\Activision\\Call of Duty 4 - Modern Warfare\\usermaps\\mp_mapname\n\nYou then place the two ff files into this folder so the mp_mapname.ff and the mp_mapnameload.ff both go into this folder.\n\nThe mp_mapname.iwd goes into your fs_game mod folder along with the files from your mod so it goes along side of the mod.ff file, the cfg&amp;#039;s and mod.iwd. At this point I will also add that you can combine your map iwd&amp;#039;s into one iwd if you so wish. This keeps the number of downloads to your clients to a lower number.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nMy ISP sucks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:76152f9f7a20ec2bc340d071160cc2b8a08f502d","amp;dn":"Call+of+Duty+4+Custom+Maps+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"76152f9f7a20ec2bc340d071160cc2b8a08f502d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,21,47,159,122,32,236,43,195,64,208,113,22,12,194,184,160,143,80,45]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
