Estleman.\n\nAdapted for radio and directed by Glyn Dearman.\n\nThe year is 1890. A ship is discovered adrift off the English coast, its crew missing, its murdered captain lashed to the wheel, and its only passanger is a sinister black dog. This impenetrable mystery is clearly a case for the inimitable Sherlock Holmes, but for the first time in his illustrious career the great detective is baffled. Clearly the crew have been murdered and dumped overboard, but what can account for the captain&amp;#039;s expression of imponderable terror and his acute loss of blood, or the ship&amp;#039;s strange cargo - fifty boxes of earth?\n\nThe game is afoot, and Sherlock Holmes, aided as ever by the faithful Dr. Watson, finds himself on the trail of no mortal enemy, but the arch-vampire himself - Count Dracula...\n\nSherlock Holmes...........John Moffatt\nDoctor John Watson........Timothy West\nCount Dracula..............David March\nProfessor Van Helsing.....Aubrey Woods\nThomas Parker..........Michael Maloney\nMr. Caffyn................Noel Howlett\nMary Watson........Theresa Streatfeild\nVampire.................Frances Jeater\nInspector Lestrade...Nicholas Courtney\nMrs. Barton.............Katherine Parr\nRed Bridger................John Hollis\n\nFirst broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on December 19th, 1981. This re-broadcast November 4th 2007.\n\nLong thought lost to the BBC archive, this marks the first time this play has been broadcast in many years. Because the BBC didn&amp;#039;t keep a copy of this, it&amp;#039;s been recovered from tape and such there is a little hiss in places, but the sound quality is very good.\n\nMy recording from BBC7 at 128kbps ABR joint-stereo LAME mp3.\n\nA ninety-minute drama, split into two parts to fit on CD.\n\nHave fun &amp; please seed.\n\nSeymourDAC\n\n:)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e8b61e10d1ad691bac7aaf01de46bd84f24b0ae","amp;dn":"Sherlock+Holmes+vs.+Dracula+by+Loren+D.+Estleman+-+BBC+Radio+-+S","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e8b61e10d1ad691bac7aaf01de46bd84f24b0ae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,139,97,225,13,26,214,145,186,199,170,240,29,228,107,216,79,36,176,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
