Terminator X, Scott La Rock, Hurricane, DJ Muggs, Dr. Dre, but none of them moved me more than the genious of DJ Premier of Gangstarr. I grew up in Syracuse NY. I was a better rapper than DJ. Then I met my mentor DJ Tes-1 whom is the best producer in upstate NY. We became close friends. He was practicing some doggy-paddling to an album, by Gangstarr. I went out and bought 2 of those albums and to this day Primo has been my mentor over the last 20 years as far as my beat production goes. \n\nMy styles have been influenced by a myriad of DJ&amp;#039;s. Now that I am 37 years old, I am not making music for money. I make it for myself. I make it for you. . Music should be free.\n\nIf you like Primo, you will love this album. I threw in some of my own Primo styled beats with some accapella&amp;#039;s  on top. \n\nPeace,\nDJ Shamrock\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;6b0f0118030a06190408002b0c060a020745080406&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9130a9aa619c845b1fe7f228fa774017e713b39d","amp;dn":"DJ+Shamrock%3A+The+Mick%5C%27s+Tape+Vol.+6++Salute+to+DJ+Premier","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9130a9aa619c845b1fe7f228fa774017e713b39d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,48,169,170,97,156,132,91,31,231,242,40,250,119,64,23,231,19,179,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
