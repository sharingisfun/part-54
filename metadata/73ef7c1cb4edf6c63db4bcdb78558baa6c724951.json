Move the dialog elements, resize and re-label them with immediate results and full control. Essential feature for translating applications.\n    * Add multi-language support to your applications\n      You can add several languages to one single application. Your application will automatically start with the correct language, i.e. the default Windows language. Multi language support can be added just using Restorator. You can not only translate applications, but also add languages!\n    * Release automated modifications - ResPatcher *)\n      Using ResPatcher you can create a small executable that will re-do your changes. That enables you to customize any application and share it with others. You can customize applications like Internet Explorer and AOL Instant Messenger and share the modifications with your friends.\n    * Grab resources in PE files anywhere on your hard drive *)\n      Grab for resources on your hard drive. This tool will find resources wherever they hide, e.g. look for all cursors on your drive and you save a lot of manual work.\n    * Locating elements in resources\n      You are looking for a specific resource in a program? Not a problem -- the resource finder will do it! \n    * Edit and update resource files that are in use.\n      Restorator can cause files to be replaced at system boot time, allowing you to modify resources within files used by Windows.\n    * Link Resource editing tools\n      Define your own tools to edit sounds images and other resources. Easy launching of your favorite image editor to edit a BMP image\n    * Resource View Modes\n      View the resources in different modes. In the Default Mode, you can listen to audio, look at images and find all resources that need translation. In Hexdump Mode, you get access to the raw data. In the RC Resource Mode, you see the resource entry in standard RC format.\n    * Adding Resources\n      Insert resources in exe or res files. Added resources are particularly useful for your created .res or .dcr files, or if you want to add custom resources to your own projects. This feature also allows adding formats/resolutions to icons and cursors.\n    * Deleting Resources\n      Your compiler creates useless resources? Want to strip debug information from the resources? Want to shrink the size of the executable file? Then you got the solution: remove resources with Restorator!\n    * UPX support\n      Open upx-compressed files seamlessly in Restorator: upon loading, the file is automatically uncompressed.\n    * Command line Support\n      With the command line parameters, you can execute Restorator conveniently from a batch program, for automated execution. It is also possible to incorporate Restorator or a ResPatch into installation programs (like InstallShield) to automate resource patching during installation.\n    * Extract all Resources\n      You can extract all resources of an application to your hard drive and work on them. Later you place all resources back in a single step. This can make translation easy with your favorite tools.\n\n\n\nPlease Note: Before you attempt to install this crack of Restorator 2007, that it has not been tested on 64- Bit Systems. I know nothing about X64 Systems and I have no idea how this would react on those systems.  USE AT YOU OWN PERIL!!!\n\nI have, however, done limited testing on 32-Bit Editions of Windows XP and Vista and it worked fine but I can&amp;#039;t make any promises that this will work for you but I thought I&amp;#039;d try to help you guys get this thing working. It&amp;#039;s my first upload, so I&amp;#039;m trying.\n\n\nOne last final Warning: I did NOT crack this program myself! I downloaded it (Can&amp;#039;t remember where or from whom) and &amp;#039;cleaned it up&amp;#039;. Meaning I did battle with an infected keygen just for you; which is why you have a reg file, a patched exe and NOT the keygen due to its evilness. Now the files are safe, scan them yourself. It only got 1 false positive at virus total.com. But still, be careful and create a system restore point just in case. \n\n\nSo...On with the show...\n\n1. Install via Restorator2007_Trial_1747.exe (When you patch file build will become 1729.)\n2. Don&amp;#039;t Run App! \n3. Import the Restorator2007 Registration Keys to the registry. (Either double-click the file and say yes or open your registry editor and import from there.)\n4. Copy the patched Restorator.exe located in the crack folder and paste it in the program&amp;#039;s folder (usually C/Program Files/Restorator 2007) overwriting the orginal.\n5. That&amp;#039;s it. Good luck. I&amp;#039;ll try to help you if you got problem; just comment.  \n\nAnd don&amp;#039;t update!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73ef7c1cb4edf6c63db4bcdb78558baa6c724951","amp;dn":"Restorator+2007+Build+1729+Full+Version+Patched","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73ef7c1cb4edf6c63db4bcdb78558baa6c724951","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,239,124,28,180,237,246,198,61,180,188,219,120,85,139,170,108,114,73,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
