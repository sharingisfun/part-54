In addition, it can read modern CPUs on-die core thermal sensors, as well has hard drives temperature via S.M.A.R.T, and video card GPU temperature. Special hardware monitors such as abitÃ‚Â® uGuru and GigabyteÃ‚Â® ODIN? power supplies series are supported too. \n* ACPI Thermal Zones support.\n* FB-DIMM integrated thermal sensor (IntelÃ‚Â® 5400A/B MCH only).\n* New sensors ICs : Analog DeviceÃ‚Â® ADM1021, ADM1027, ADM1030.\nHWMonitor does not copy any file in any directory, neither writes in the registry.\n\n\n\nCPU-Z 1.44.1 is a freeware that gathers information on some of the main devices of your system. \n\nCPU\n\n    * Name and number.\n    * Core stepping and process.\n    * Package.\n    * Core voltage.\n    * Internal and external clocks, clock multiplier.\n    * Supported instructions sets.\n    * Cache information.\n\nMainboard\n\n    * Vendor, model and revision.\n    * BIOS model and date.\n    * Chipset (northbridge and southbridge) and sensor.\n    * Graphic interface.\n\nMemory\n\n    * Frequency and timings.\n    * Module(s) specification using SPD (Serial Presence Detect) : vendor, serial number, timings table.\n\nSystem\n\n    * Windows and DirectX version.\n \n\n\n\nPC Wizard 2008.1.84  \nSince 1996 PC WIZARD is among the most advanced system information programs on the market. PC WIZARD 2008 is a powerful utility designed especially for detection of hardware, but also some more analysis. It&amp;#039;s able to identify a large scale of system components and supports the latest technologies and standards. This tool is periodically updated (usually once per month) in order to provide most accurate results.\n\nPC WIZARD 2008 is also an utility designed to analyze and benchmark your computer system. It can analyze and benchmark many kinds of hardware, such as CPU performance, Cache performance, RAM performance, Hard Disk performance, CD/DVD-ROM performance, Removable/FLASH Media performance, Video performance, MP3 compression performance.\n\nPC WIZARD 2008 can be distributed freely (ftp, archives, CD-ROMs ...).\n\nHardware Information\n\n    * Mainboard / Bios (Connectors, ID String, MP Support ...)\n    * Chipset (FSB Frequency, Norhtbridge, Hub, Direct Media Interface, XMB, NSI, ...)\n    * Main Memory (FPM, EDO, SDRAM, DDR SDRAM, DDR-2 SDRAM, DDR-3 SDRAM, RDRAM, FB_DIMM, Timings ...)\n    * Memory Profiles : EPP (SLi Ready), Intel XMP.\n    * Cache Memory (L1, L2, L3, Size, Frequency ...)\n    * Processors (Type, Speed, Multiplier coeff., Features, Model Number, Vanderpool Technology ...)\n    * Coprocessor\n    * APM &amp; ACPI\n    * Busses : ISA, PCI, AGP (2x, 4x,8x), SMBus/ i2c, CardBus, Firewire, Hyper-Transport ... )\n    * DMI / SMBIOS\n    * Mainboard Sensors, Processor, Hard Disk &amp; Battery (Voltage, Temperature, Fans)\n    * Video (Monitor, Card, Bios, Capabilities, Memory, Integrated Memory, Frequencies ...)\n    * OpenGL &amp; 3Dfx\n    * DirectX (DirectDraw, Direct3D, DirectSound (3D), DirectMusic, DirectPlay, DirectInput, DirectX Media)\n    * Keyboard, Mouse &amp; Joystick\n    * Drives (Hard Disk, Removable, CD-ROM, CDRW, DVD ...)\n    * SCSI (Card, Controller, Adapter, Devices ...)\n    * ATA/ATAPI &amp; S-ATA (Devices, Type, Capabilities, S.M.A.R.T.

The compression ratio is better than UPX. Some Antivirus Programs shown a FALSE POSITIVE by all programs packed with XComp. These AV scanners have a outdated scan engine and can not scan inside the packed executable. I don&amp;#039;t care whether they update them AV engines or not and let me force to use UPX or PE Compact. The Main AntiVirus Programs can handle this packer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e799914a629482262d6a7238210cebae4498c2bf","amp;dn":"EVEREST+Ultimate+v4.20.1306+%2B+Corporate+Edition+v4.20.1305+%2B+Sys","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e799914a629482262d6a7238210cebae4498c2bf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,153,145,74,98,148,130,38,45,106,114,56,33,12,235,174,68,152,194,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
