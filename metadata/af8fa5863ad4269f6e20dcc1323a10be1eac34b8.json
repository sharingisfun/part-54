This is the first album ever released by Dylan with a cartoon of the artist on the sleeve. The sleeve was drawn by Jun Miura, a personal friend of Dylan &amp; one of the most famous comic artists in Japan. According to Sony/Japan, Dylan had always been reluctant to use a cartoon on an album sleeve, until now. The release features a 52-page booklet with lyrics to all the tracks along with a host of other comic sketches of Dylan. Though no rare material is included this is one for legions of Dylan collector&amp;#039;s.
