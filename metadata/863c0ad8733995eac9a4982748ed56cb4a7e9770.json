It was essentially an encyclopedia in comic book form, listing the characters, places, and things in the DC Universe. It began one month before the 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths began, and therefore it is of interest to note that the earlier issues contemplate the characters pre-Crisis, whereas issues released subsequent to the conclusion of the limited series discuss the post-Crisis universe. For example, while both the Flash (Barry Allen) and Supergirl died during the Crisis, the Flash&amp;#039;s death is not mentioned as issue #8 predates his death, but Supergirl&amp;#039;s death is recounted 14 months later in issue #22. Also, entries for characters such as the Silver Age Superman and Wonder Woman recounted their post-Crisis histories only, which at the time were only a few months old, while their entire Silver Age histories (and all the unique elements of those characters during that time, such as Superman&amp;#039;s Fortress of Solitude and Wonder Woman&amp;#039;s powerless period) were ignored.\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:863c0ad8733995eac9a4982748ed56cb4a7e9770","amp;dn":"Definitive+Directory+of+the+DC+Universe%28Catseye2001%29+%5Bh33t%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"863c0ad8733995eac9a4982748ed56cb4a7e9770","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,60,10,216,115,57,149,234,201,164,152,39,72,237,86,203,74,126,151,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
