It starts with the Countdown issues 2, 1, and 0 which concluded 3 main Punisher series. For some reason The Punisher thinks that it was Nick Fury that killed his family which lead The Punisher on his out for justice man hunt.\n\nThe story begins with Double Edge Alpha, Tie-ins in Daredevil, Dr Strange, The Incredible Hulk, and Ghost Rider have &quot;Over the Edge&quot; imprint so that&amp;#039;s why they are there. I don&amp;#039;t know of any other tie-ins related to the story arc. I sorted them in one order but I think it&amp;#039;s not crucial in which order are they read. For example Dr Strange has only four-five pages that involve Nick Fury and it&amp;#039;s a part of another Dr Strange arc. It ends in Double Edge Omega but the last Hulk issue is added like some sort of aftermath although it doesn&amp;#039;t have the imprint.[/quote]\n\n\nBIG THANKS to all the scanners involved.\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE BOOK, THEN BUY THE COMICS OR THE TRADES.
