FOUND BY A MAN.\n\nThe legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table receives its most impressive screen treatment in Excalibur, from visionary moviemaker John Boorman (Deliverance, The General).\nAll the elements of Sir Thomas Malory&amp;#039;s classic `Le Morte D&amp;#039;Arthur&amp;#039; are here: Arthur (Nigel Terry) removing the sword Excalibur from the stone; the Round Table&amp;#039;s noble birth and tragic decline; the heroic attempts to recover the Holy Grail; and the shifting balance of power between wily wizard Merlin (Nicol Williamson) and evil sorceress Morgana (Helen Mirren).
