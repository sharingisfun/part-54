Track 2 - Percy X\n\nIn the liner notes of his album, Josh Wink explains the importance of mix tapes in his life, as an educational tool and learning experience of new forms of music. As his audience, he now tries to make mix tapes to achieve, &quot;musical diversity...and to hear what's going on in the DJ's head.&quot; Apparently, Wink has been thinking about dark, often minimal house music, and a flawless mix, even if it costs that diversity he so values.\n\nHave no doubt that this is a professional production; the mixing is tight and unnoticeable, and most songs have been reworked to fit the aesthetic he strives for. The sound, while dark, minimal and mostly devoid of vocals, is still lively and engaging, a crafty paradox that makes this disc so successful. Meaning, for every percolating track like, &quot;What's the time, Mr. Templar,&quot; you get the flitting chimes of &quot;Vol. 1&quot; by Care Company. When the album hits a bit of a drone in the middle (track 7's &quot;Pop Culture&quot;) it quickly follows with the fly-girl attitude fun of &quot;K-mart Shopping.&quot;\n\nYet striving for sound purity and technical quality does come with a trade-off, as seen most recently by the trance parallel piece, John Digweed's Global Underground 014: Hong Kong. By choosing form, the function of music is compromised. It's dance music that's more engaging than exciting.\n\nAll that said, it's still a remarkable piece that holds to its vision and forges a new sound; it just prefers to be dance art rather than dance music. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:100981b318d379d08f8724eddef6f2d5db3b13d7","amp;dn":"osh+Wink+-+Profound+Sounds+Vol.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"100981b318d379d08f8724eddef6f2d5db3b13d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,9,129,179,24,211,121,208,143,135,36,237,222,246,242,213,219,59,19,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
