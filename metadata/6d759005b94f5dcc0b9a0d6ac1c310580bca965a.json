Now known exclusively by \n       his secret identity, Bob Parr, he lives with his wife Helen, \n       formerly Elastigirl, and their three children Violet, Dash, and Jack \n       Jack. He works as an insurance claims specialist, and he's fed up \n       with his pushy boss and his immoral profession, but his wife's \n       worked too hard to build a normal life for her family to abide his \n       nostalia for heroism. When Mr. Incredible's offered the chance to \n       play the role of hero again by a mysterious informant, he jumps at \n       the opportunity, but when it turns out to be a trap set by an old \n       nemesis he had a hand in corrupting, the whole family must reveal \n       themselves to save Mr. Incredible and countless innocents.
