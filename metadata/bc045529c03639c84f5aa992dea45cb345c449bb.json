At first I thought it would be something like a school movie about evolution, but it turned out as a work of plainly contemplative (at some points almost voyeuristique) piece of art. The movie will disappoint people who expect a plot line. It comes rather along like a slideshow, intriguingly framed by Bruno Coulais' experimental soundtrack (which, however, gets out of hand at the end). Beautiful colourful macro pictures. The movie's best actor, the mudskipper, almost gives you the impression that you are being watched by the movie. A joyful avantgarde experience. For those who enjoy little offstream movies. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc045529c03639c84f5aa992dea45cb345c449bb","amp;dn":"Genesis+movie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc045529c03639c84f5aa992dea45cb345c449bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,4,85,41,192,54,57,200,79,90,169,146,222,164,92,179,69,196,73,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
