After seeing the second and third one, I thought I was convinced that they couldn&amp;#039;t make another one that would match up to the original with Natasha Henstridge but I was wrong because this one came very close. The story is very entertaining and there are some good sequences of violence too unlike number 3. I was really entertained by this one because I watched it at like 3 in the morning and I watched it all. Overall I give it an 8 out of 10 because it was the best since the original and it is a great thriller. I would recommend it to all fans of the Species movies and of course to all the sci-fi fans out there like me. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b755631e935c462915b602e3356c176da83313ca","amp;dn":"Species.4.Il.Risveglio.%5B2007.ITA.STV.LTD.DVDRip.XviD%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b755631e935c462915b602e3356c176da83313ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,85,99,30,147,92,70,41,21,182,2,227,53,108,23,109,168,51,19,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
