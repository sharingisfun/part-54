They completely retexture the old EQ world, as well as Kunark and Velious.  It makes a HUGE difference and things look much better with them.  After realizing that EverQuest Titanium does not come with the updated textures (and I couldn&amp;#039;t find a patch elsewhere), I decided to rip them from my Shadows of Luclin CD&amp;#039;s.\n\nTO USE:\n\nJust unrar into your EverQuest directory, overwriting all existing files.  \n\nThere shouldn&amp;#039;t be any problems with these files and they seem to work just fine for me, but please use at your own risk.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c79520f55b175e763387df71e608ee7fe24b355","amp;dn":"EverQuest+Updated+Textures.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c79520f55b175e763387df71e608ee7fe24b355","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,121,82,15,85,177,117,231,99,56,125,247,30,96,142,231,254,36,179,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
