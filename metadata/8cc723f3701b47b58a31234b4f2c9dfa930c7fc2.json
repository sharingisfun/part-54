From a new generation of rising singers of the exiled Iranian community based in Southern California, he is now ranked as one of the top male singers of the Iranian music scene. Beside Iran, he also has a fan base in Afghanistan, Iraq, Tajikistan and to a limited extent Uzbekistan and Russia.\nDespite the Iranian governmentÃƒÂ¢??s restrictions on pop music, he has nevertheless been able to eclipse other singers in gaining a wide recognition in that country. Equally popular among both men and women, his songs now serve various ceremonial openings of events, such as soccer games, weddings and private parties. Due to the lively nature of his music that has engaged and absorbed the youth of Iran, he is now permanently banned from returning or performing for any reason in that country\n\n\nTrack List :\n\n\n(Ferferehaye Bi Bad)\n01- Ferferehaye Bi Bad\n02- Hesab\n03- Khanegi\n04- Nazanin\n05- Parandehaye Bi Vatan\n06- Sayeboun\n07- Bahar Oumad\n08- Zendouni\n\n\n\n(Tasvire Akhar)\n01- Ghaab\n02- Sokoute Shekaste\n03- Paaiz\n04- Tasvire Akhar\n05- Dooset Daram\n06- Dobare Haa\n07- Instrumental\n\n\n\n(Dariche)\n01- Dariche\n02- Hame Ra Mibakhsham\n03- Jashne Setareha\n04- Avare\n05- Aghoushe To\n06- Shakheye Shekaste\n\n\n\n(Ghayeghe Kaghazi)\n01- Yade To\n02- Chashme Siaat\n03- Ghayeghe Kaghazi\n04- Parandehaye Bi Vatan\n05- Atre Gole Yakh\n06- Bahar Oumad\n\n\n\n(Faghat Be Khatere To)\n01- Faghat Be Khatere To\n02- Eshghe Aatishi\n03- Chashman Siah\n04- Vaghti Nisti\n05- Entezaar\n06- Benevis\n\n\n\n(Zendegi)\n01- Zendegi\n02- Yeki Boud, Yeki Naboud (Remix)\n03- Dooset Daram\n04- Nazok Narenji\n05- Bebin\n06- Yeki Boud, Yeki Naboud\n07- Are Khodeshe\n08- Groove With Dr. Fred\n\n\n\n(Divoune)\n01- Bezan Berim\n02- Divoune\n03- To Azize Delami\n04- Mano Bebakhsh\n05- Bad Akhlagh\n06- Delam Faghat To Ro Mikhad\n07- Ghararemoun Yadet Nare\n08- Tarane Bi Tarane\n\n\n\n(Farari)\n01- Farari\n02- Mikhamet\n03- Azadi\n04- Arezoume\n05- Doroughgo\n06- Yadete\n07- Shirin\n08- Mara Bebous\n09- Eydi Nadaram (Be Yade Zelzeleye Bam)\n\n\n\n(Ghashangeh)\n01- Doone Doone\n02- Ghashangeh\n03- Engar Na Engar\n04- Dado Bidad\n05- Bazi\n06- Nemitouni\n07- Baa Man Beh Az In Bash\n08- Ye Rouzi\n09- Dastamo Begir","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cc723f3701b47b58a31234b4f2c9dfa930c7fc2","amp;dn":"Mansour+Discography+%28Persian+Music%29%5Bwww.upersia.com%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cc723f3701b47b58a31234b4f2c9dfa930c7fc2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,199,35,243,112,27,71,181,138,49,35,75,79,44,157,250,147,12,127,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
