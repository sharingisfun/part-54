The plot is based on an unnamed protagonist who struggles with his growing discomfort with consumerism and changes in the state of masculinity in American culture. In an attempt to overcome this, he creates an underground fighting club as a radical form of psychotherapy. It was made into a movie of the same name in 1999 by director David Fincher. The movie became a pop culture phenomenon. In the wake of the film&amp;#039;s popularity, the novel has become a target of criticism, mainly for its explicit depictions of violence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08272b2fb6ba576abe7a5f74b4357ba9bcc58f03","amp;dn":"FIGHT+CLUB+-+%5BENG%5D%5B1996%5D+-+LIBRE+%26+VERITAS+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08272b2fb6ba576abe7a5f74b4357ba9bcc58f03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,39,43,47,182,186,87,106,190,122,95,116,180,53,123,169,188,197,143,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
