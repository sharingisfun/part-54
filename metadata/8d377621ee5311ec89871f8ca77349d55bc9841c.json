Features interviews with Doors drummer John Densmore, Doors manager Bill Siddons, Pamela Courson&amp;#039;s mother, Jim&amp;#039;s best friend Frank Lisciandro, the fireman who responded to the emergency call and discovered his body, Herve Muller (Jim&amp;#039;s friend while he was in Paris), and others. \n\nA great documentary, but unfortunately (for non-French speaking people) it&amp;#039;s completely in French. This needs English subtitles! \n\nAny French-speaking viewers care to give it a shot and translate it for us American Doors fans? \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d377621ee5311ec89871f8ca77349d55bc9841c","amp;dn":"The+Last+Days+Of+Jim+Morrison+%5BFrench+-+Needs+Eng+Subs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d377621ee5311ec89871f8ca77349d55bc9841c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,55,118,33,238,83,17,236,137,135,31,140,167,115,73,213,91,201,132,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
