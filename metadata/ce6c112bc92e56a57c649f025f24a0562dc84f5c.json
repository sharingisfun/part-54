The cinematography and locations were excellent, and the entire feel and look of the film was some of the best I have seen in a while. The card tricks were quite interesting and the twists in the plot kept me quite thoroughly entertained. While overall a very good movie, the very calculated pace and flow of the movie was very much like a poker game. In some cases tense, exciting and often unexpected, and in others very slow, as if the movie were building up to a winning hand. All in all, a very well made movie, but not perfect. I give it an 8/10.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323939/&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;IMDb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;1 h, 31 min lÃƒÂ¥ng.
