(for John David) Souther was never a front-runner during the peak of the L.A. singer/songwriter boom of the &amp;#039;70s and &amp;#039;80s, but he was never far from those who were. His songwriting for one-time lover Linda Ronstadt and for the Eagles, which evolved out of Ronstadt&amp;#039;s backing band, provided them both with some fine material (including the Eagles&amp;#039; &quot;Heartache Tonight,&quot; &quot;Best of My Love,&quot; and &quot;New Kid in Town&quot;), and as one-third of the underrated Souther-Hillman-Furay Band with ex-Poco frontman Richie Furay and original Byrds member Chris Hillman, he was briefly in the spotlight as a performer. Souther also recorded four solo albums, two of which charted but didn&amp;#039;t really establish him as a major force, but until now his representation on CD has been slim. This British compilation draws from all four of those solos and Souther-Hillman-Furay, and reveals Souther to be a smart craftsman of up-tempo country-rock and ballads. &quot;If You Have Crying Eyes,&quot; a duet with Ronstadt, is typical, driven by a shimmering acoustic guitar, Souther&amp;#039;s plaintive lead vocals, the pair&amp;#039;s close harmonies, and tight backing from an orchestra&amp;#039;s worth of support musicians. The title track, by the SHF band, is a spirited tune from 1974 filled out by pedal steel guitar and Joe Lala&amp;#039;s crisp percussion, and &quot;You&amp;#039;re Only Lonely,&quot; Souther&amp;#039;s best known solo song, pays a respectful tribute to his fellow Texan Roy Orbison without really mimicking him. \n\n-=Product Description=-\n\n2007 compilation from the ground-breaking singer/songwriter who helped create the Country Rock sound as well as had a hand in the Laurel Canyon Soft Rock scene as well. Co-writing Eagles hit singles and forming Souther Hillman Furay with former members of The Byrds and Poco may have put his name in lights, but his oft-overlooked solo career is what is chiefly on display on this excellent collection. 19 tracks including two with Hillman and Furay and two with long-time friend and supporter Linda Ronstadt. Salvo. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------\nARTiST..[ J. D.
