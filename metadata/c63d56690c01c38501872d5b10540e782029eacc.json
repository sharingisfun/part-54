I consider Van to be one of the best songwriter's of our time and he proves it again with this album and there isn't really one true commmercial hit on this album, which is unique. The title track along with others are enjoyable but other tracks like &amp;quot;Underlying depression&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Ancient Highway&amp;quot; are truly touching and emotional. I would recommend it to any old or new Van Morrison fan. I rate it as one of my favorite Van albums of all time. \n\nVan Morrison\nDays Like This (1995)\nCD to mp3 @ 320 kbps + covers.\nApprox 133.4Mb\n\nTrax\n01   Perfect Fit\n02   Russian Roulette\n03   Raincheck\n04   You Don't Know Me\n05   No Religion\n06   Underlying Depression\n07   Songwriter\n08   Days Like This\n09   I'll Never Be Free\n10   Meloncholia\n11   Ancient Highway\n12   In The Afternoon\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c63d56690c01c38501872d5b10540e782029eacc","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+-+Days+Like+This+%281995%29+%40+320+++covers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c63d56690c01c38501872d5b10540e782029eacc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,61,86,105,12,1,195,133,1,135,45,91,16,84,14,120,32,41,234,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
