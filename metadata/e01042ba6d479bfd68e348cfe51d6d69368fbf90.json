Put this in you collection. He plays the calculating Borgia to perfection.  But it is Everett Sloane as Mario Belli that is in my opinion the most interesting character and the best actor in the film.\n\nI must have been 10 or 11 years old when I first remember seeing this movie.  There is one scene toward the end that I remembered even when I forgot the rest.  I just recently found this one and scared my wife to death when I was watching this and shouted &quot;I FOUND IT&quot;, when it got to this scene.  Can you guess the scene?\n\nAt any rate here is the IMDB:\nIn 1500, Duke Cesare Borgia hopes to marry his sister (widowed by poison) to the heir apparent of Ferrara, which impedes his conquest of central Italy. On this delicate mission he sends Andrea Orsini, his sister&amp;#039;s lover and nearly as unscrupulous as himself. En route, Orsini meets Camilla Verano, wife of the count of Citta&amp;#039; del Monte (Borgia&amp;#039;s next intended conquest); and sentiment threatens to turn him against his deadly master, whom no one betrays twice...
