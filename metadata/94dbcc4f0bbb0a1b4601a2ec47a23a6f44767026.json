This is not a rip. It is the official release spreading.\nThe tracker is connected to the original Ubuntu release, so you will have thousands of seeders.\n\n\n\n\nLinux has never been better or easier. If you have never tried linux - it is time!\n\nThis version is for almost all PCs. This includes most machines with Intel/AMD/etc type processors and almost all computers that run Microsoft Windows, as well as newer Apple Macintosh systems based on Intel processors.\n\n8.04\nVersion 8.04, codename Hardy Heron, is the latest stable release. It will receive security updates until June 2012.\nTo run the Desktop CD (LiveCD + Install CD), you need 128 MB RAM to run or 192 MB RAM to install. The Alternate Install CD only requires you to have 64 MB RAM.\n\nTo install Xubuntu, you need 1.5 GB of free space on your hard disk.\n\nOnce installed, Xubuntu can run with 192 MB RAM, but it is strongly recommended to have at least 256 MB RAM.\n\nThe desktop CD allows you to try Xubuntu without changing your computer at all, and at your option to install it permanently later. This type of CD is what most people will want to use. \n\nIf you have a more powerful machine u might want to try Kubuntu or Ubuntu\n\nFor more info.
