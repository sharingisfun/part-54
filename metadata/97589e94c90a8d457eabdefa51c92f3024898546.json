Espousing a free-spirited highlife as well as an existential and intellectual aesthetic, the French underground heartily embraced American jazz. Showcasing traditional styles as well as ambitious adaptations that reveal reggae, African, and even hip-hop influences, this collection is tasteful and eclectic includes two of the most famous French female pop stars, Jane Birkin and Fran?oise Hardy, in duets with Jimmy Rowles and Iggy Pop, respectively. . Angelique Kidjo&amp;#039;s version of &quot;Summertime&quot; is gently evocative, as is Dee Dee Bridgewater&amp;#039;s moving rendition of &quot;Watermelon Man.&quot; The Jazz Passengers and Debbie Harry interpret &quot;There Is No More Tomorrow,&quot; and French chanteuse Fran?ois Hardy is joined by Iggy Pop for a version of &quot;I&amp;#039;ll Be Seeing You.&quot; With artists old and new, Jazz A Saint Germain is a vibrant, engaging affair. \n\nHighly Recommend!!\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.
