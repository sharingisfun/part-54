Itay is 31 years old and comes from Tel Aviv/ Israel. He has \nbeen listening to trance music since he was 16 years old. He spent over two \nyears working as a sound engineer in one of the top three sound and light \ncompanies in israel. His decision to make music was strongly influenced by his \ntrip to Ibiza in 1997-8 where he visited Juan&amp;#039;s (Muses Rapt) studio. At that \ntime he also started to dj in Israel and abroad at mostly underground parties \n. During his travels he also played in Cusco, Peru as well as in New York along \nwith Total Eclipse.\n\nItay&amp;#039;s general musical influences are wide-ranging His journey into chill-out \ndjing started in 2002 in Israel. During that time he was also signed by a UK \ntechno-house label (www.klubdj.co.uk) under the name DJ Itay for a year \nand flew to Japan to play at parties in Osaka and Kyoto. Returning back to \nIsrael, he enroled to sound engineering college for one year and totally \ncommited himself to music composition. Drawing from his djing experience, his \nearly family musical influences as well as his own musical background he \ncreated his chill-out project: KUKAN-DUB-LAGAN. It is a combination of three \nseparate words: KUKAN, which means &quot;space&quot; in japanese; DUB which \nrepresents the music style; and, LAGAN, comes from the word &quot;ba-lagan&quot; \nwhich in hebrew means &quot;chaos&quot;. The debut album of Kukan-Dub-Lagan &quot;Life is \nNice&quot; has been released by Candyflip-Records/Greece.His unique music style \ncan be best described as psy-chill free dub. In simpler words &quot;sunshine music \nfor smiling people&quot;!! Itay got another project of psy progressive style as \n&quot;ItaiTaiko&quot;-released on Dance n Dust records/israel and Groove Zone \nrecords/Japan...and more to be announced.... as well another project as \nRAIJIN GAIJIN","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5eac9e85ddd19b8a8802145fbdf180a0a791af9","amp;dn":"Kukan%5C%27s+Dub+Journey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5eac9e85ddd19b8a8802145fbdf180a0a791af9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,234,201,232,93,221,25,184,168,128,33,69,251,223,24,10,10,121,26,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
