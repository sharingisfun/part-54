I am re-upping it in FLAC for those that prefer this format like I do. It didn&amp;#039;t come with any documentation or log files but I had a listen and it sounds like lossless to me. Post below if you&amp;#039;d disagree.\n\nTrack List:\n   1. Busted\n   2. Do The Rump\n   3. I&amp;#039;ll Be Your Man\n   4. Countdown\n   5. The Breaks\n   6. Run Me Down\n   7. Leavin&amp;#039; Trunk\n   8. Heavy Soul\n   9. She Said, She Said\n  10. Them Eyes\n  11. Yearnin&amp;#039;\n  12. Brooklyn Bound\n  13. 240 Years Before Your Time\n\nRemember, Lossless files can be converted to any format without loss of quality (unless your converting to a lossy format) so these are perfect copies of the original audio from the CD.\n\nEnjoy your listening experience...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29e9b73df3d422e1777dc91094306372ef1d49a3","amp;dn":"Black+Keys+-+The+Big+Come+Up+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29e9b73df3d422e1777dc91094306372ef1d49a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,233,183,61,243,212,34,225,119,125,201,16,148,48,99,114,239,29,73,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
