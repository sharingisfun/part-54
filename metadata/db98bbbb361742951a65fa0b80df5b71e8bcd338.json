It examines the relationships - \npredatory, competitive and co-operative - on which species   \nsurvival depend; considers the ascent of man in the          \nevolutionary ladder - and determines how, uniquely, we have  \nmanaged to break free from it.                               \n\nProgramme 5 of 5 : Human Life                                \n\nFive million years ago we separated from our chimpanzee      \ncousins. Steve Leonard looks back to explain how landscape   \nchanges drew us down from the trees and out on to the newly  \nformed African savannah.                                     \n\n[Notes]\n\nNo normal subtitles are included on this DVD so I've         \nincluded English hard-of-hearing subtitles for those who     \nare not too clued up with the spoken English language :)     \n\n                               -=-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:db98bbbb361742951a65fa0b80df5b71e8bcd338","amp;dn":"%5BNEW%5D+Journey+Of+Life+S01E05+XViDVDRip-NiNJA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"db98bbbb361742951a65fa0b80df5b71e8bcd338","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[219,152,187,187,54,23,66,149,26,101,250,11,128,223,91,113,232,188,211,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
