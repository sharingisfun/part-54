When they get there, however, it turns out that the guy who invited them has taken off with all the money, and the rest of the hosts have a VERY limited budget. They are actually expecting Burt Reynolds and Dolly Parton, so our heroes gets to be Mr. Burt and Mr. Dolly. We follow them around Amsterdam, at their hotel, (still) smokin' joints and doing shows.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7db2fa9ec011a2b7cbfaa6d647bf3a573ed4991","amp;dn":"Cheech+and+Chong-Still+Smokin%5C%27+1983.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7db2fa9ec011a2b7cbfaa6d647bf3a573ed4991","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,219,47,169,236,1,26,43,124,191,170,109,100,123,243,165,115,237,73,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
