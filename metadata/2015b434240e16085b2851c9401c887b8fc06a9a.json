I show you a surprise parcel and my plan for a vacation in Croatia. Then it is a bit about GIMP - how to draw simple figures. I start with a straight line and end with a curved path. While editing I found a lot missing that should have been told here. Well, there will be a next episode. ;-)\n\nYou can order the DVD from Derek Shaw.

There will be also a guest speaker from the Blender crew, a great program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2015b434240e16085b2851c9401c887b8fc06a9a","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_048_Simple_Graphics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2015b434240e16085b2851c9401c887b8fc06a9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,21,180,52,36,14,22,8,91,40,81,201,64,28,136,123,143,192,106,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
