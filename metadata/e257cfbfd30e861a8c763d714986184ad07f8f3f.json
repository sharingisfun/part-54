True, they often followed the same stylish, sunny, utterly infectious sound, but there was a lot more depth and variety there, as Rhino&amp;#039;s terrific 20-track collection Tightening It Up: The Best of Archie Bell &amp; the Drells illustrates. What it reveals to those that weren&amp;#039;t playing close attention is that the group was one of the first great Philly soul outfits, recording a number of Gamble &amp; Huff&amp;#039;s early songs and providing a training ground for the seminal duo. Though the hits didn&amp;#039;t come fast and furious, like they would later, they, Bell &amp; the Drells, created some wonderful singles, highlighted by &quot;(There&amp;#039;s Gonna Be A) Showdown&quot; and &quot;A World Without Music.&quot; There&amp;#039;s plenty of other terrific moments throughout this collection, which proves that Bell &amp; the Drells were far more than a one-hit wonder -- they were one of the great under appreciated soul outfits of their time.\n\n\n\n\n01.
