It was taken in the garden of the Whitley family house in Oakwood Grange Road, Roundhay, a suburb of Leeds, Yorkshire, Great Britain, possibly on October 14, 1888. It shows Adolphe Le Prince (Le Prince\\&amp;#039;s son), Mrs. Sarah Whitley, (Le Prince\\&amp;#039;s mother-in-law), Joseph Whitley and Miss Harriet Hartley. The \\&amp;#039;actors\\&amp;#039; are shown walking around in circles, laughing to themselves and keeping within the area framed by the camera. It lasts for less than 2 seconds and includes 24 frames.\n\n\n\nIncredibile video !!!\n\nInfo:\n\n\nYear: 1888\nDirector: Louis AimÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Augustin Le Prince\nCast: Harriet Hartley,Adolphe Le Prince,Joseph Whitley,Sarah Whitley\nCountry: British Empire\n\n\n------------\nMady by FireBlade\nMy torrents on : http://thepiratebay.se/user/fireblade_bg2\n------------\n\nEnjoy and SEED !\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be9715c512eb6c0484b7ccc5cb0660f6a069e3d1","amp;dn":"The+first+movie+ever+1888+-+FireBlade","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be9715c512eb6c0484b7ccc5cb0660f6a069e3d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,151,21,197,18,235,108,4,132,183,204,197,203,6,96,246,160,105,227,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
