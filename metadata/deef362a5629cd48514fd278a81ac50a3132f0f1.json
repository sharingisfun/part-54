November 12, 2007\n\nPresenting official data on unidentified aerial phenomena\nPromoting international cooperation among governments and the military in investigating UFOs\n\nModerated by former Arizona Governor\nFife Symington\n\nSponsored and organized by\nJames Fox, Documentary Filmmaker\nLeslie Kean, the Coalition for Freedom of Information\n\n-----&gt; http://www.freedomofinfo.org/national_press.htm &lt;-----\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nNEWS ADVISORY\n\nFor immediate release: Thursday, Nov. 1, 2007\nFor further information Contact: Leslie Kean \n\n\nUFO Close Encounters\n\n- The Reality as Seen by Former High Level Government and Military Officials\n- Pilots to Tell Their UFO Stories for the First Time\n- Group to call on US Government to Re-Open its Investigation\n\nThe American public is not alone when it comes to sighting what the US Air Force has labeled Unidentified\nFlying Objects (UFOs). So too have former governors, high level military and government officials, highly\ntrained airplane pilots and aviation experts. The phenomenon is real. It happens worldwide. No one is sure about\nits nature. Experts from seven countries will divulge what they have discovered about UFOs at a November 12\npanel discussion moderated by former Arizona Governor Fife Symington (R) at the National Press Club.\nJust one year ago, pilots, mechanics and managers from United Airlines witnessed a metallic disc-shaped object\nhovering over the United Airlines Terminal at Chicago?s O?Hare Airport. The clearly observed object shot\nstraight up leaving a hole through the clouds. Despite the clear aviation safety issues involved, the Federal\nAviation Administration (FAA) never investigated the incident and dismissed it as weather. This head-in-theclouds\nrefusal to investigate stands in sharp contrast to efforts by governments of other countries to understand\nthese incidents.\n\n?I believe that our government should take an active role in investigating this very real phenomenon,? said\nSymington, who was a witness to the famed ?Phoenix Lights? incident seen by hundreds in Arizona while he was\ngovernor. ?This panel consists of some of the most qualified people in the world with direct experience in dealing\nwith this issue, and they will bring incredible, irrefutable evidence, some never presented before, that we simply\ncannot dismiss or ignore,? he said.\n\nThe group, using previously classified documents, will discuss many well-documented cases, including two\ninvestigated by the US government. The first involves a Peruvian Air Force pilot who fired many rounds at a\nUFO which was not affected. The second was an Iranian Air Force pilot?s attempt to fire at a UFO, but whose\ncontrol panel became inoperable. ?This case is a classic that meets all the necessary conditions for a legitimate\nstudy of the UFO phenomenon,? stated the US Defense Intelligence Agency document on the Tehran incident.\nBoth pilots will come forward to speak about these events publicly for the first time.\n\n\nWHO: \n\n\n- Fife Symington, Former Arizona Governor, Moderator\n- Ray Bowyer, Captain, Aurigny Air Services, Channel Islands\n- Rodrigo Bravo, Captain and Pilot for the Aviation Army of Chile\n- General Wilfried De Brouwer, former Deputy Chief of Staff, Belgian Air Force (Ret.)\n- John Callahan, Chief of Accidents and Investigations for the FAA, 1980?s (Ret.)\n- Dr. Anthony Choy, founder, 2001, OIFAA, Peruvian Air Force\n- Jean-Claude Duboc, Captain, Air France (Ret.)\n- Charles I. Halt, Col. USAF (Ret.), Former Director, Inspections Directorate, DOD I.G.\n- General Parviz Jafari, Iranian Air Force (Ret.)\n- Jim Penniston, TSgt USAF (Ret.)\n- Dr. Claude Poher, Centre National d?Etudes Spatiales, founder, French GEPAN\n- Nick Pope, Ministry of Defence, UK, 1985-2006\n- Dr. Jean-Claude Ribes, Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, France, 1963-98\n- Comandante Oscar Santa Maria, Peruvian Air Force (Ret.)\n\nWHAT: \n\nFormer Arizona Governor Fife Symington will moderate a distinguished panel of former\nhigh-ranking government, aviation, and military officials from seven countries to discuss\nclose encounters with what the US Air Force describes as Unidentified Flying Objects\n(UFOs). Representatives from France, England, Belgium, Chile, Peru, Iran and the US\nwill call for the US Government to join in an international dialogue and re-open its\ninvestigation ? which the Air Force shut down over 30 years ago ? in cooperation with\nother governments currently dealing with this unusual and controversial phenomenon.\nWhile on active duty, the panelists have either witnessed a UFO incident or have\nconducted an official investigation into UFO cases relevant to aviation safety and\nnational security.\n\nWHEN: \n\nMonday, November 12, 2007 11:00 AM\n\nWHERE: \nNational Press Club Ballroom\n\nEvent open to credentialed media and Congressional staff only\n\nCONTACT: \n\nJames Fox, documentary filmmaker; director of the acclaimed film ?Out of the Blue?\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;c5afa4a8a0b6a6a3aabd85a2a8a4aca9eba6aaa8&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \n\nLeslie Kean, investigative journalist with the Coalition for Freedom of Information\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;9ef2f5fbfff0def7e6b0f0fbeafdf1f3b0fdf1f3&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;567b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b7b&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;------------------\n\nTorrent compiled and uploaded by geogaddi00 () to:\n\nUtopiated - http://utopiated.net/ (part of Exopolitics UK: http://exopolitics.org.uk/ )\nConspiracy Central - http://conspiracycentral.net:6969/\nThe Pirate Bay - http://thepiratebay.se/\nalt.binaries.ufo.files a.b.documentaries a.b.paranormal a.b.conspiracy a.b.multimedia\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deef362a5629cd48514fd278a81ac50a3132f0f1","amp;dn":"National+Press+Club+-+November+12th+2007+-+UFO+Close+Encounters","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deef362a5629cd48514fd278a81ac50a3132f0f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,239,54,42,86,41,205,72,81,79,210,120,168,26,197,10,49,50,240,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
