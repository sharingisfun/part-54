Whilst Franklin tries to build up a relationship based on trust with the boys, he unlocks their hidden talents, teaching them to read and appreciate poetry, recruiting Liam Mercier (John Travers), an exceptionally talented boy to help him take on the challenge. Discovering the same kind of repression and tyranny he fought against in Spain, at St.Jude's, Franklin continues to have flashbacks from his days in the Spanish Civil War and part of his life that he lost.\n\nWhen on Christmas day, Brother John gratuitously beats two young brothers, who have broken a school rule, Mercier and Franklin curtail the violence but not for long: Brother John's determination to find out why Franklin has decided to teach at St. Jude's, results in more brutality, with unimaginable consequences. \n\n\nAmiens International Film Festival 2003\nAudience Award for Best Feature Film\nGolden Unicorn for Best Feature Film\n\nCopenhagen International Film Festival 2003\nGolden Swan (Aisling Walsh)\n\nFlanders International Film Festival 2003\nSpecial Jury Prize (Aisling Walsh)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82e0bd08f31f6e2089ddacbb7ae5e82016154ea6","amp;dn":"Song.for.a.Raggy.boy.SUBFRENCH.DVDRiP.XViD-By-PiCdR.Share-by-%28TN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82e0bd08f31f6e2089ddacbb7ae5e82016154ea6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,224,189,8,243,31,110,32,137,221,172,187,122,229,232,32,22,21,78,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
