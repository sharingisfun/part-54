Feynman\n\nThese are the lectures in physics that I gave last year and the year before to the\nfreshman and sophomore classes at Caltech. The lectures are, of course, not\nverbatim - they have been edited, sometimes extensively and sometimes less so.\nThe lectures form only part of the complete course. The whole group of 180\nstudents gathered in a big lecture room twice a week to hear these lectures and\nthen they broke up into small groups of 15 to 20 students in recitation sections\nunder the guidance of a teaching assistant. In addition, there was a laboratory\nsession once a week.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6ce2ad56d2bd9a7b0f96a31e5791bf9d1d212e1","amp;dn":"Feynman%3A+Lectures+on+Physics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6ce2ad56d2bd9a7b0f96a31e5791bf9d1d212e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,206,42,213,109,43,217,167,176,249,106,49,229,121,27,249,209,210,18,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
