They met\ndown by the harbor and boarded the ship they had spent years constructing.\nThe crew werenÃƒÂ¢??t any rookies, they where also working on other ships like\nTiger Lou, Firefox AK, Starmarket, Norma and Seven Feet Four. But\nsomething about this journey felt very special, nobody knew why.\nThe journey they were about to embark on was planned to the detail.\nThe goal was to find something they had never seen before. They untied the\nship, pulled up the anchor and sailed away towards unknown waters.\nAfter a couple of months on board a heavy storm attacked the ship.\nThe crew was thrown around, masts broke and water started leaking in from\nholes in the hull. When they thought they were beyond any hope they\nspotted land by the horizon. What they saw was an island, an island nobody\nhad ever heard of.\nThe castaways crawled up on the island and found that this place\nhad everything they were looking for; monotone krautrock, epic arenarock\nand quirky indierock. There werenÃƒÂ¢??t any limits here, as opposed to what\nthey were used to in the music dictatorship at home. Here was everything\naloud; saxophone solos, mountaintop guitars, cheesy pianos and harmony\nvocals. They named the island ÃƒÂ¢??Republic of TorpedoÃƒÂ¢??.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f86c53d3d830bdef0ed201ccc92356cf02b81b3","amp;dn":"Torpedo+-+In+The+Assembly+Line","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f86c53d3d830bdef0ed201ccc92356cf02b81b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,134,197,61,61,131,11,222,240,237,32,28,204,146,53,108,240,43,129,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
