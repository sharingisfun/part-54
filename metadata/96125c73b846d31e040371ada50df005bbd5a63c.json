Flying Circus, then the twin surprises of RP&amp;AK and Sharon Little, Robert and Alison raking in applause and acclaim on every stop, and more to talk about on FBO than there has been in ages.  A stream of newbies both to FBO and to The TimD Series, and lots of new discussion for everyone.\n\nTo the new folks here, please feel free to go back and get the shows you missed - we&amp;#039;re deep into the series now, but all the shows are being seeded.  Other than that, it&amp;#039;s time to move on.  Ever onward, and here. we. go...\n\nLandover, Maryland 5.26.77.  The Capital Center.  A basketball arena/hockey rink/barn, so AUD recordings are damn inconvenient.  Well, it&amp;#039;s a good thing this is a complete soundboard, huh?  At the time of its release, there were no known silvers of this recording, which is complete with No Quarter and Bron-Y-Aur Stomp in full soundboard quality, both rarities in soundboards.  Not a perfect show, but the sound quality along with a flawed but inspired performance make this a good off-the-beaten-path show to have.  The show is even named after the sticky-fingered Pagey performance, &quot;Refreshing Mistakes.&quot;\n\nThe 1977 tour is up and down, as we all know, as far as performances, but this is a good one and it&amp;#039;s available bootleg-free, profit-free, for you this week. \n\nLed Zeppelin\nCapitol Center\nLandover, MD\nUSA\n05-26-77\n\n&amp;#039;Refreshing Mistakes&amp;#039;\n\nOriginal CD-R(1) set &gt; EAC (test and copy with correct offsets) &gt; WAV &gt; Flac Level 6\n\nThis has to be the cleanest soundboard around from this era\nPhenomenal sound!!\nNo known silvers out at all!!\nTo be copied before there are, lossless only!!- evan772\n\nDisc 1 (66.29):\n\nThe Song Remains The Same\nThe Rover/Sick Again\nNobody?s Fault But Mine\nIn My Time Of Dying\nSince I?ve Been Loving You\nNo Quarter\n\n\nDisc 2 (49.25):\n\nTen Years Gone\nThe Battle Of Evermore\nGoing To California\nDancing Days\nBlack Country Woman\nBron-Yr-Aur Stomp\nWhite Summer/Black Mountain Side\nKashmir\n\nDisc 3 (76.39):\n\nOut On The Tiles/Moby Dick\nGuitar Solo\nAchilles Last Stand\nStairway To Heaven\nWhole Lotta Love\nRock And Roll\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96125c73b846d31e040371ada50df005bbd5a63c","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+1977.05.26+-+Landover","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96125c73b846d31e040371ada50df005bbd5a63c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,18,92,115,184,70,211,30,4,3,113,173,165,13,240,5,187,213,166,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
