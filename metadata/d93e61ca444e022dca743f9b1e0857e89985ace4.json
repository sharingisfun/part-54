In \n   Hunter: The Reckoning - Redeemer, the hunt continues as a \n   new Hunter joins the original team of 4 in their fight to \n   save the citizens of Ashcroft from a twisted plot to take \n   over the innocent town. Players battle against hordes of \n   supernatural enemies in single-or multi-player mode - they \n   do whatever it takes to get the job done.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d93e61ca444e022dca743f9b1e0857e89985ace4","amp;dn":"Hunter.The.Reckoning.Redeemer.XBOX-WAM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d93e61ca444e022dca743f9b1e0857e89985ace4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,62,97,202,68,78,2,45,202,116,63,155,30,8,87,232,153,133,172,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
