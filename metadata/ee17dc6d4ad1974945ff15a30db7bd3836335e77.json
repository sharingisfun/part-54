The flavorful &amp;quot;Changes&amp;quot; is like viewing a good oil painting; the slow moody instrumental has a meditating effect, and a soft, airy flute makes for an inconspicuous lead instrument. &amp;quot;Promised Heights,&amp;quot; the title cut, is strong, and should have done better for Cymande. It has the lilt and beauty of earlier sides, the horn work is sensational and a nice sax solo scintillates. That same looping reggae beat is matched with meaningful lyrics and a positive, working-together theme on &amp;quot;Losing Ground.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;The Recluse&amp;quot; has a great hook (&amp;quot;When will all the lights go, will they leave the blackest night&amp;quot;) and features a nice romping beat spiced by sweeping horns. Cymande is a perfect example of music's universal appeal; despite not knowing 70% of what they're saying, you're still drawn into the sounds. - from AMG.\n\nenjoy and seed :]\n\n/owl","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee17dc6d4ad1974945ff15a30db7bd3836335e77","amp;dn":"Cymande+-+Promised+Heights+%281974%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee17dc6d4ad1974945ff15a30db7bd3836335e77","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,23,220,109,74,209,151,73,69,255,21,163,13,183,189,56,54,51,94,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
