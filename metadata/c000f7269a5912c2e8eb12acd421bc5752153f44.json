Emperor penguins in their thousands abandon the deep blue security of their ocean home and clamber onto the frozen ice to begin their long journey into a region so bleak, so extreme, it supports no other wildlife at this time of year. In single file, the penguins march blinded by blizzards, buffeted by gale force winds. Guided by instinct, by the otherworldly radiance of the Southern Cross, they head unerringly for their traditional breeding ground where--after a ritual courtship of intricate dances and delicate maneuvering, accompanied by a cacophony of ecstatic song--they will pair off into monogamous couples and mate. The females remain long enough only to lay a single egg. Once this is accomplished, exhausted by weeks without nourishment, they begin their return journey across the ice-field to the fish-filled seas. The male emperors are left behind to guard and hatch the precious eggs, which they cradle at all times on top of their feet. After two long months during which the males eat nothing, the eggs begin to hatch. Once they have emerged into their ghostly white new world, the chicks can not survive for long on their fathers&amp;#039; limited food reserves. If their mothers are late returning from the ocean with food, the newly-hatched young will die. Once the families are reunited, the roles reverse, the mothers remaining with their new young while their mates head, exhausted and starved, for the sea, and food. While the adults fish, the chicks face the ever-present threat of attack by prowling giant petrels. As the weather grows warmer and the ice floes finally begin to crack and melt, the adults will repeat their arduous journey countless times, marching many hundreds of miles over some of the most treacherous territory on Earth, until the chicks are ready to take their first faltering dive into the deep blue waters of the Antarctic.\n\n\nIMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0428803/\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net !\n\nTotal file size: 2.62 GB\n\nTracker URL: http://www.sharego.net:2710/announce\n\nAVInaptic Report:\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: March Of The Penguins.mkv\nDate: 21/02/2008 09:08:14\nSize: 2,817,457,066 bytes (2686.936 MB)\n\n[ Generic infos ]\n\nPlay duration: 01:20:16 (4815.936 s)\nContainer type: matroska\nCreation time: 21/02/2008 14:00:57 UTC\nNumber of streams: 4\nType of stream nr. 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (A_AC3) {Main}\nType of stream nr. 3: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {English Subtitles}\nType of stream nr. 4: subtitle (S_VOBSUB) {Spanish Subtitles}\nAudio streams: 1\nMuxing Application: libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\nWriting Application: mkvmerge v2.1.0 (&amp;#039;Another Place To Fall&amp;#039;) built on Dec 31 2007 20:13:50\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 1280 x 720\nWidth: multiple of 32\nHeight: multiple of 16\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution: 1280 x 720\nFrame aspect ratio: 16:9 = 1.777777\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 16:9 = 1.777777\nFramerate: 23.975985 fps\n\n[ Audio track ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AC3\nChannels (container): 6\nSample rate: 48000 Hz\nMode: 3 front, 2 rear, 1 LFE","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c000f7269a5912c2e8eb12acd421bc5752153f44","amp;dn":"March+Of+The+Penguins+HD+720p+SeCtIoN8+%7BSharegoRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c000f7269a5912c2e8eb12acd421bc5752153f44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,0,247,38,154,89,18,194,232,235,18,172,212,33,188,87,82,21,63,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
