Censorship. Enforced political conformity. Hostility to diversity of opinion. Sensitivity training.

But American higher education bears a disturbing resemblance to the totalitarian societies that are anathema to our nation&amp;#039;s ideal of liberty. Evan Coyne Maloney&amp;#039;s documentary film, Indoctrinate U, reveals the breathtaking institutional intolerance you won&amp;#039;t read about in the glossy marketing brochures of Harvard, Berkeley, Michigan, Yale, and hundreds of other American colleges and universities.\n\n\nFormat: Divx\n\nimdb: http://imdb.com/title/tt1137970/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4042ab737072a55b32de2015cea261feb36e6339","amp;dn":"Indoctrinate+U+%28Lower+Quality+Divx+Version%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4042ab737072a55b32de2015cea261feb36e6339","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,66,171,115,112,114,165,91,50,222,32,21,206,162,97,254,179,110,99,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
