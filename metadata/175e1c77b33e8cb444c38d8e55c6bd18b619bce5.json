In a career that dates back to the start of the sixties he has had top selling singles, released ground breaking albums, composed the Grammy and Oscar winning film score for &quot;Shaft&quot;, supplied the voice of Chef in &quot;South Park&quot; and written innumerable hit songs for other artists. Isaac Hayes has made several appearances at Montreux but this one, his most recent appearance from 2005, undoubtedly captures him at his very best with trademark performances of all his best-known tracks.
