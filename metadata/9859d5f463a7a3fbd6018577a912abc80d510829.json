Black stars as a loveable loser stuck in a life that\\&amp;#039;s too small for his big dreams. But when he unintentionally erases all the tapes in a video store where his best friend (Mos Def) works, he devises a plan to satisfy the store\\&amp;#039;s few loyal customers by re-creating and re-filming every movie they decide to rent. Be Kind Rewind features a cast that also includes Danny Glover, Melonie Diaz and Mia Farrow. It is scheduled for a February 22, 2008 release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9859d5f463a7a3fbd6018577a912abc80d510829","amp;dn":"Be+Kind+Rewind+%5BBlackberry+Pearl+8100%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9859d5f463a7a3fbd6018577a912abc80d510829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,89,213,244,99,167,163,251,214,1,133,119,169,18,171,200,13,81,8,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
