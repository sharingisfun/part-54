Bobby Womack and J.J. Johnson - Across 110th Street\n\n\n\n1972&amp;#039;s ACROSS 110TH STREET is a brilliant collaboration between soul great Bobby Womack and jazz legend J.J. Johnson. Based on Wally Ferris&amp;#039; novel about inner-city life, crooked cops and ripping off the mob, this film demanded exciting music. Both artists contribute some of their finest work, which is often interspersed with film dialogue. Although Johnson&amp;#039;s string arrangements on parts I and II of the title track bring to mind Gamble &amp; Huff&amp;#039;s Philly soul, Womack&amp;#039;s delivery makes it sound more like Curtis Mayfield&amp;#039;s &quot;Shaft.&quot; Elsewhere, Womack turns &quot;Hang on in There&quot; into an acid-rock workout dominated by a Duane Allman-like slide guitar absent from Johnson&amp;#039;s funkier, horn-driven treatment.\n\nOther strong Womack compositions include the JB hard rock of &quot;Do It Right&quot; and the fast-paced &quot;Quicksand.&quot; Johnson&amp;#039;s highlights include the syncopated strut &quot;Harlem Clavinette&quot; and &quot;Harlem Love Theme,&quot; a melancholy ballad featuring pizzicato bass and a somber exchange between electric piano and English horn.\n\n\n\n01.

Willie Hutch - The Mack\n\n\nWhen an act called Sisters Love were offered a cameo in the blaxploitation film The Mack, their manager suggested that Willie Hutch do the soundtrack. It became to be one of the great &amp;#039;70s film scores, including a pair of classic funk tunes, &quot;Brothers Gonna Work It Out&quot; and the title cut. The results proved to be another soundtrack that far surpassed the quality of its film. (AMG)\n\n\n\n01.
