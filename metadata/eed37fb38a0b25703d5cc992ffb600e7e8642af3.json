There is no quality loss at all.\n\nTickets for this damn event were gone in like an hour after they were\nreleased.\n\nYou may ask &quot;Why did I change containers?&quot; Becuase MKV is a free and\nopen standard container. The original container was in proprietary\nMOV. Plus, I seem to have saved ~60 MiB by changing containers. I never\nknew the MOV container had that much overhead.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eed37fb38a0b25703d5cc992ffb600e7e8642af3","amp;dn":"Barrack+Obama+-+2008-03-28+-+Pittsburgh+Rally","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eed37fb38a0b25703d5cc992ffb600e7e8642af3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,211,127,179,138,11,37,112,61,92,201,146,255,182,0,231,232,100,42,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
