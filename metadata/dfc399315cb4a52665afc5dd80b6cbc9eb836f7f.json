Her voice was a special instrument, with an airy flutelike quality in every register, and her singing could be playful or passionate. On this 1987 recording, Carter&amp;#039;s voice is mixed right down amid the instruments and each song emerges as a collective creation, a sustained work with Carter at the helm, inspiring her associates. Tenor saxophonist Don Braden blends memorably with Carter on the ballads &quot;The Man I Love&quot; and &quot;Make It Last,&quot; while the singer&amp;#039;s gifts as a tutor and talent scout are confirmed here by the presence of two outstanding young pianists, Stephen Scott and Benny Green. --Stuart Broomer\n\nThis album won her the 1988 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female.\n\nPersonnel: Betty Carter (vocals); Don Braden (tenor saxophone); Stephen Scott, Benny Green (piano); Michael Bowie, Ira Coleman (bass); Winard Harper, Lewis Nash, Troy Davis (drums).\n\nRecorded at Clinton Recording and Mediasound, New York, New York.\n\nTrack Listing:\n   1. &quot;Look What I Got!&quot; (Betty Carter) ? 5:41\n   2. &quot;That Sunday, That Summer&quot; (Joe Sherman, George David Weiss) ? 4:51\n   3. &quot;The Man I Love&quot; (George Gershwin, Ira Gershwin) ? 7:28\n   4. &quot;All I Got&quot; (Diane Cole) ? 4:40\n   5. &quot;Just Like the Movies&quot; (Time) (Carter) ? 4:20\n   6. &quot;Imagination&quot; (Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen) ? 4:23\n   7. &quot;Mr. Gentleman&quot; (Sequel to &quot;Tight&quot;) (Carter) ? 2:40\n   8. &quot;Make It Last&quot; (Bob Haymes) ? 6:00\n   9. &quot;The Good Life&quot; (Sacha Distel, Jack Reardon) ? 6:58","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfc399315cb4a52665afc5dd80b6cbc9eb836f7f","amp;dn":"Betty+Carter+-+Look+What+I+Got%21+%281988%29+RESEED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfc399315cb4a52665afc5dd80b6cbc9eb836f7f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,195,153,49,92,180,165,38,101,175,197,221,128,182,203,201,235,131,111,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
