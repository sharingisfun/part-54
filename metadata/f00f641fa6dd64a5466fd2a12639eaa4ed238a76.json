Music Director Jeannette Sorrell gathers a select pool of dynamic and creative early-music artists from throughout North America and Europe. The ensemble has been praised internationally for stylistic freshness and buoyancy, animated spontaneity, technical excellence, and for the creativity of Sorrell&amp;#039;s programming.\n\nApollo&amp;#039;s Fire was founded in 1992 by Jeannette Sorrell, with the assistance of Roger Wright, then Artistic Administrator of the Cleveland Orchestra (now with the BBC). The orchestra received a startup grant from the Cleveland Foundation in 1992, and made its debut to critical acclaim in June of that year. Since then, Apollo&amp;#039;s Fire has performed in Toronto, Washington D.C., Indianapolis, Philadelphia, Columbus, Detroit, Pittsburgh, with the American Bach Project in Milwaukee, and the New World Symphony&amp;#039;s Baroque Festival in Miami. In 2004 Apollo&amp;#039;s Fire appeared at two prestigious international festivals: the Gilmore International Festival in Michigan, and the Ojai Festival (CA) presenting Bach&amp;#039;s St John Passion with &quot;stunning eloquence.&quot;\n\nApollo&amp;#039;s Fire is frequently broadcast on National Public Radio and can also be heard on Britain&amp;#039;s BBC, Canada&amp;#039;s CBC, European Community Radio, and in Northeast Ohio on WCLV and WKSU. Apollo&amp;#039;s Fire has been featured on several national holiday broadcasts on NPR as well as NPR&amp;#039;s World of Opera and SymphonyCast.\n\nTogether with Jeannette Sorrell, Apollo&amp;#039;s Fire received the 1995 Noah Greenberg Award from the American Musicological Society, given for an outstanding project involving the collaboration of scholars and performers, and was awarded the 1998 Northern Ohio Live Achievement Award for Classical Music.\n\nIn Cleveland we&amp;#039;re lucky to have one of the finest orchestras in the world, the Cleveland Orchestra.  We&amp;#039;re doubly lucky to have this group recording and performing and bringing new life to these works.  If you enjoy this, please support them!\n\nCD1\n01 - Concerto No. 1 in F, BWV 1046: 1.
