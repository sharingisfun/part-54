This time, Chili becomes a different kind of Ã¢â‚¬Å“hitÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ man Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he abandons the movie industry to bring his wiseguy skills and negotiation tactics to the music business.\n\nWhen a friend is offed while theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re at lunch, Chili takes the opportunity to visit the guyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife, Edie (Thurman), and pitch himself as her new business partner at an independent record label. With a promising young pop-star-in-training as his protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© (Milian), Chili has to juggle her faux-urban manager (Vaughn), his gay, wannabe-actor bodyguard (The Rock), Russian mobsters, and an eloquent gangsta music producer (Cedric) to save the label and land a hit Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and keep from getting popped himself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4bc106793e45131d3f700eddd8f817347821ed7c","amp;dn":"Be+Cool+-+2005++Xvid+%28incl+optional+dutch+subtitels%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4bc106793e45131d3f700eddd8f817347821ed7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,193,6,121,62,69,19,29,63,112,14,221,216,248,23,52,120,33,237,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
