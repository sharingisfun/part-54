I&amp;#039;ve deleted the Flash stories and left only the Doctor Fate ones, co-written by Martin Pasko.  \n\nI made them the only way I know how, by turning them into RAR files.  There&amp;#039;s no real need to extract them. Your reader should be able to open and browse through them just fine. Leaving them in the RAR format will help make it easier to keep the torrent alive as well.\n\nEnjoy.  And thanks to the people on the Flash torrent where I took these from.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9919828530e694c9a138a9f5bf5ff5dd87f8786","amp;dn":"Doctor+Fate+-+Flash+310-313+-+Stever+Gerber","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9919828530e694c9a138a9f5bf5ff5dd87f8786","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,145,152,40,83,14,105,76,154,19,138,159,91,245,255,93,216,127,135,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
