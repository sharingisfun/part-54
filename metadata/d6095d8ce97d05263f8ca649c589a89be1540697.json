This program includes four interlocking security services: a firewall, an application control, an Internet lock, and Zones. The firewall controls the door to your computer and allows only traffic you understand and initiate. The Internet lock blocks Internet traffic while your computer is unattended or while you&amp;#039;re not using the Internet, and it can be activated automatically with your computer&amp;#039;s screensaver or after a set period of inactivity. Zones monitor all activity on your computer and alert you when a new application attempts to access the Internet. Version 7.0.362 may include unspecified updates, enhancements, or bug fixes.\n\nNote:ZoneAlarm is free for individual and not-for-profit charitable entity use (excluding governmental entities and educational institutions). Advanced features are available.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d6095d8ce97d05263f8ca649c589a89be1540697","amp;dn":"Zone+Alarm+10.326.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d6095d8ce97d05263f8ca649c589a89be1540697","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,9,93,140,233,125,5,38,63,140,166,73,197,137,168,155,225,84,6,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
