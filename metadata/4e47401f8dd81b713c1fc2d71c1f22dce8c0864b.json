Excellent stuff, sounds a little like Jon Anderson on some vocals. Long out of print and very hard to find. I'll be re-seeding this every Saturday (midnight, PST/PDT). If there are no seeds available, leave your client up or bring it up on Saturdays.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e47401f8dd81b713c1fc2d71c1f22dce8c0864b","amp;dn":"Eddie+Jobson+-+Zinc+%28The+Green+Album%29+-+1983","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e47401f8dd81b713c1fc2d71c1f22dce8c0864b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,71,64,31,141,216,27,113,60,31,194,215,28,31,34,220,232,192,134,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
