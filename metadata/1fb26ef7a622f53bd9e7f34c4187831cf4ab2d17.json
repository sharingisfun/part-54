To my annoyance, I had never actually heard of Beatrik until this CD found its way to me for reviewing around a year ago, even though I&amp;#039;m a big fan of the majority of Avantgarde Music&amp;#039;s releases. I can honestly say, after finally experiencing them (with this being their second album release), and now knowing what they achieved on their debut effort (which was slightly more raw styled black metal), you can tell that Beatrik have that certain something to set them apart. What we have on offer here is excellent doomy dirge-like black metal at its very best, bringing to mind prime slabs of Xasthur, Wigrid, Forgotten Tomb, Nortt and even early Katatonia in equal amounts, effervescing and sparking away in a filthy cauldron over a pile of blackened bones and a foreboding, angry flame.\n\nHypnotic chiming and discordant guitar work is woven over the most basic drum lines, and topped with grimy jarring Varg-like barks. The songs are mainly mid-paced, and on average are roughly eight minutes long, although they do have the occasional blast-ridden section when the bile is fully raised, and the vocal department begins to sound as if desolation and despondency have been captured in corporeal form, transferred to aural format and been laid alongside a musical accompaniment.\n\nLet this not fool you into thinking that &quot;Requiem of December&quot; is not without its hugely placid moments too, as it has some really doom-laden passages with church bells tolling as an accompaniment, intertwined with melancholic acoustic guitar and church organ styled keyboards exuding the overall dark vibe of morbid sorrow. Just listen to track four &amp;#039;Eternal Rest&amp;#039;, with its imaginatively radiant use of trickling stream and birdsong samples alongside sad, downcast guitar ÃƒÂ¢?? striking in its magnificence.\n\nBeatrik are definitely a tasty prospect and I still give this album a regular spin on many an occasion. Beg, steal or borrow to get your dirty little mitts on this, live on moss and rain water for a month if you must, but trust me ÃƒÂ¢?? you need to hear this if you consider yourself a fan of extreme music.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/1275702&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.discogs.com/release/1275702&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://musicbrainz.org/release/8c7a3472-442f-43be-b635-120a7f716adb.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://musicbrainz.org/release/8c7a3472-442f-43be-b635-120a7f716adb.html&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=5589&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=5589&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEAC Lame 3.79 v0 VBR with log","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fb26ef7a622f53bd9e7f34c4187831cf4ab2d17","amp;dn":"Beatrik+%282005%29+-+Requiem+of+December+%2AItalian+Black%2FDoom+Metal%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fb26ef7a622f53bd9e7f34c4187831cf4ab2d17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,178,110,247,166,34,245,59,217,231,243,76,65,135,131,28,244,171,45,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
