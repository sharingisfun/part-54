Much of the unnecessary exposition and the more annoying elements of the film is removed. Overall 20 minutes were cut for a way more intense ride through the infected streets of London.\n\nOriginal film name: 28 Weeks Later\nNew film name: 27 Weeks Later...\nFilm studio name: Fox Atomic Pictures/DNA Films\nOriginal runtime: 90 minutes\nNew runtime: 70 minutes\nAmount of time cut: 20 minutes\n\nCuts removed/added/extended:\n\n    * Changed all instances of &quot;28&quot; to &quot;27&quot; keeping consistent with the CBB edit of 28 Days Later.\n    * Less soldiers\n    * No &quot;entering London&quot; sequence\n    * Don no longer follows his kids\n    * Includes digitally removing Don from two shots\n    * Also reduced much of the sight of him as an Infected\n    * Underground sequence is audio only (no video, total darkness)\n    * Rescored Leaving Britain sequence (it was at this point where In The House - In A Heartbeat was overused)\n    * Recut the Leaving Britain sequence to fit the music\n    * Some custom credits\n\nSoftware used:\n\n    * Sony Vegas Pro 8\n    * The GIMP (for digital character removal)\n\n-------\n\nAbout this file:\n    * Container: MPEG-4\n    * Video: H.264\n    * Audio: AAC Stereo\n\nA full DVD version is in the works.

Because it&amp;#039;s not some cheap cut and paste job. A person with an actual life edited this, in their very limited spare time, purely for fun. If you don&amp;#039;t get it, then don&amp;#039;t bother with this at all.\n\nIf you hit and run on this torrent and any other of mine (that is, download the whole thing and don&amp;#039;t bother to seed) you thoroughly deserve to have your ISP poison your torrents.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af1782bdf47069176f19cef176a704fea46d54d7","amp;dn":"27+Weeks+Later+-+a+fan+edit+by+Ghostcut+Pictures","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af1782bdf47069176f19cef176a704fea46d54d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,23,130,189,244,112,105,23,111,25,206,241,118,167,4,254,164,109,84,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
