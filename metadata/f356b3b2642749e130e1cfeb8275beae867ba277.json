BETTER play metal, dig? And believe me, the decibels these heavy-bearded Pennsylvanians are playing is 117% METAL. Imagine the crunch and clarity of early, greasy Metallica mixed with the chain rattling biker metal of Black Label Society, and you?ve got the sweat n? leather, loud and proud sound of Omegalord. I?m pretty sure that every song here is about drugs and motorcycles, but none of ?em more so than massive opener ?Skullbong?. Holy fucking rock and roll, this one sounds like red meat and overtime, it?s so goddamn manly. Thick, two-ton riffs, head cracking vox, and drums that sound like a PCP freak smashing his head through a wall. It makes you wanna DO things, like hunt animals or drive off a cliff. It?s intense, Jack. And imagine that, they do not pussy out later on. The Hammer is DOWN, baby. If you go for a good full-throttle ass kicking, strap on your biggest belt-buckle and dive right into this savage chopper metal trough. You know, if yer man enouge.----Sleazegrinder","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f356b3b2642749e130e1cfeb8275beae867ba277","amp;dn":"Omegalord-Hammer+Down+%28Stoner+Metal%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f356b3b2642749e130e1cfeb8275beae867ba277","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,86,179,178,100,39,73,225,48,225,207,235,130,117,190,174,134,123,162,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
