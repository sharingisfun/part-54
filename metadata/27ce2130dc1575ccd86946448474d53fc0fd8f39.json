No matter what type of player you are, Full Tilt Poker has what you are looking for.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWelcome to Full Tilt Poker, the online home of some the most respected poker players in the world. Designed by the pros, we try to incorporate all the best features that make playing and learning a pleasurable experience. Not only do our pros have decades of cumulative experience playing at the poker tables, they also bring a wealth of knowledge about the online poker world.\n\nRules/Games\n\nTexas Hold &amp;#039;em is probably the best known and most popular form of poker today.\n\nEach player starts with two hole cards. There are three rounds of community cards. These are dealt face up, for every player to use, with betting after each round.\n\nThe best 5-card hand using any combination of the five community cards and two hole cards wins.\n\nEach new hand begins with a small blind, a big blind, and a round of betting. The betting rules vary depending upon whether the game is Limit, Pot Limit or No Limit.\n\n\n\nOnce the first round of betting is complete, the dealer then puts out the first three community cards, or &quot;the flop&quot;. There is a round of betting.\n\n\n\nThe dealer then puts out the fourth community card or &quot;the turn&quot;. There is a round of betting.\n\n\nThe dealer then puts out the fifth community card or &quot;the river&quot;. There is a final round of betting.\n\n\nAfter the last round of betting, the software will award the pot to the best hand.\n\nAll Hold &amp;#039;em games include a small blind and big blind. These are forced bets, and are determined by the position of the button. These bets are considered live, and every player in the hand must either call the big blind, raise, or fold. The button moves clockwise around the table, giving each player a turn being the button, small blind, and big blind.\n\n\nIn Limit Hold &amp;#039;em, each betting round has a fixed bet. In $5/$10, the small blind is $2.50, the big blind is $5, and the first two rounds of betting are in increments of $5. The last two rounds of betting are in increments of $10. There is a maximum of three reraises per betting round.\n\nIn Pot Limit, a player can bet any amount from the minimum bet to the size of the pot. In a $5/$10 pot-limit game, the small blind is $5 and the big blind is $10. The first player can call the big blind (in this case, $10), or raise to any amount up to the size of the pot. A raise must either equal or exceed the previous bet or raise. In this case, a pot-sized raise would be $25 ($5 small blind + $10 big blind + $10 call), meaning that, in total, player three can bet up $35. Supposing player three makes a pot-sized raise, the total pot is now $50.\n\nIf the next player wants into the hand, they must call $35, which is the size of player three&amp;#039;s bet. If they want to raise the maximum, they would bet $120, which equals the size of the pot ($50) plus a $70 raise ($5 call + $35 raise).\n\nIn No Limit Texas Hold &amp;#039;em, a player can bet any amount from the minimum bet to the maximum number of chips they have in front of them. As in pot limit, a $5/$10 No Limit game means blinds of $5 and $10.\n\nIn Tournament Hold &amp;#039;em, the blinds will increase after timed intervals. And while Texas Hold &amp;#039;em generally does not have antes, in tournaments, the later rounds will include antes based upon the escalating betting limits.\n\nOmaha Poker, or Omaha Hi, is a variation of Hold &amp;#039;em played with four hole cards instead of two. At showdown, the best five-card hand using exactly two of your hole cards and three cards from the board wins. Unlike Hold &amp;#039;em, you may not use more than three cards from the board. The betting and blinds are exactly the same as in Hold &amp;#039;em.\n\nAt the beginning of each hand, each player is dealt four hole cards. There is a small blind, a big blind, and a round of betting.\n\nIn Pot Limit, a player can bet any amount from the minimum bet to the size of the pot. In a $5/$10 pot-limit game, the small blind is $5 and the big blind is $10. The first player can call the big blind (in this case, $10), or raise to any amount up to the size of the pot. A raise must either equal or exceed the previous bet or raise. In this case, a pot-sized raise would be $25 ($5 small blind + $10 big blind + $10 call), meaning that, in total, player three can bet up $35. Supposing player three makes a pot-sized raise, the total pot is now $50.\n\nIf the next player wants into the hand, they must call $35, which is the size of player three&amp;#039;s bet. If they want to raise the maximum, they would bet $120, which equals the size of the pot ($50) plus a $70 raise ($35 call + $35 raise).\n\n\n\nOnce the first round of betting is complete, the dealer then puts out a three card flop, just as in Hold &amp;#039;em. There is a round of betting. In the above example, the minimum bet would be $10 (the size of the big blind), and the maximum bet would be the size of the pot.\n\nAll raises in all remaining rounds behave as described above.\n\n\n\nThe dealer then puts out a fourth (or turn) card, followed by a round of betting.\n\n\n\nThe dealer then puts out a fifth (or river) card, followed by a round of betting.\n\n\n\nThe winner is the player who makes the best possible five card hand using exactly two cards from their hand and three cards from the board.\n\nThis is important. Unlike Hold &amp;#039;em, in Omaha Hi Poker you cannot use just one card from your hand, nor can you play the board.\n\nFor example:\n\nYour hand: Ah Kc Qc Jc The board: 3h 4h 5h 6h 7h\n\nYou DO NOT have an ace-high nut flush, nor can you simply play the board for a straight flush. Using two cards from your hand, your best hand is:\n\nAh Kc 7h 6h 5h\n\nIn other words, you should have folded.\n\nOmaha Hi/Lo is a variant of Omaha. The betting, blinds, and postings are exactly the same as in Omaha. If you&amp;#039;re not familiar with Omaha, click here for a quick lesson. At the showdown, the pot is split between the holder of the highest hand, and the holder of the lowest hand, if the low hand qualifies.\n\nTo qualify for a low hand, you must have five distinct cards (no pairs), with no card higher than an 8. Remember, since you have to play two cards in your hand, the two cards in your hand and three on the board all need to be 8 or lower. Straights and flushes do not count against you. The best 5-card low hand is A-2-3-4-5 of any suit. The hand is &quot;ranked&quot; by starting with the highest low card. 7-4-3-2-1 would be considered a 7-low, and would lose to 6-4-3-2-1, a 6-low. If two players each have low hands with the same highest card, the next highest card determines the winner. 7-5-4-3-2 loses to 7-4-3-2-1. If there is no qualifying low hand, the high hand wins the entire pot.\n\nJust as in the high version of Omaha, each player starts with four hole cards, and then the dealer places five cards face-up in the center of the table. These community cards are part of each player&amp;#039;s hand, so each player has access to seven cards. The difference between Omaha high and Omaha Hi/Lo, is that in Omaha Hi/Lo each player can potentially have two different hands: a high hand and a low hand.\n\nEach player forms a five-card high hand by using only two (no more, no less, but they can be any two) of his hole cards together with only three (no more, no less, but they can be any three) of the five community cards. Each player forms a five-card low hand (if possible) by using only two (no more, no less, but they can be any two) of his hole cards together with only three (no more, no less, but they can be any three) of the five community cards. Both the high hand combination and the low hand combination can use the same set of cards, but they don&amp;#039;t have to; in fact, usually they would not.\n\nBecause of the qualifier restriction, if at least three cards 8 or lower do not appear among the community cards, a low hand is not possible.\n\nSeven-card Stud Hi/Lo is a variant of Seven-card Stud. If you need a quick refresher on the basics of Seven-card Stud, click here.\n\nThe betting, ante, and bring-in are exactly the same as in Seven-card stud. At the showdown, the pot is split between the holder of the highest hand and the holder of the lowest hand, if the low hand qualifies.\n\nTo qualify for a low hand, you must have five distinct cards (no pairs), with no card higher than an 8. Straights and flushes do not count against you. The best 5 card low hand is A-2-3-4-5 of any suit. The hand is &quot;ranked&quot; by starting with the highest low card. 7-4-3-2-1 would be considered a 7-low, and would lose to 6-4-3-2-1, a 6-low. If two players each have low hands with the same highest card, the next highest card determines the winner. 7-5-4-3-2 loses to 7-4-3-2-1. If there is no qualifying low hand, the high hand wins the entire pot.\n\nThe only betting difference is that fourth street does not offer an optional increase in the betting limit, regardless of any pairs on the board. In Seven-card stud Hi/Lo, the first two betting rounds are always at the lower limit, and the last three always at the higher limit.\n\nJust as in the high version of Seven-card stud, each player starts with two hole cards and one upcard; there are then three more rounds of upcards, with betting after each card, and a final downcard, followed by a final betting round. Each player ends up with seven cards: four face up and three face down.\n\nIn Seven-card Stud Hi/Lo, each player forms a high hand and, if possible, a qualifying low hand, using any five of his seven cards. Both the high hand combination and the low hand combination can use the same set of cards, but they don&amp;#039;t have to. As in Seven-card Stud, aces play both \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27ce2130dc1575ccd86946448474d53fc0fd8f39","amp;dn":"Full.Tilt.Poker.Bonus.Package.%28Includes.Cash.Code%29.PC.Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27ce2130dc1575ccd86946448474d53fc0fd8f39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,206,33,48,220,21,117,204,216,105,70,68,132,116,213,63,192,253,143,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
