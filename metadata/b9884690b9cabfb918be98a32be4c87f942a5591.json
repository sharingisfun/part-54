I make no apologies to those who are already proficient in WAP to some degree, or who are already programming in another scripting language. After more than 30 years working with and around computers, I know that there is always something else to know or find out, even in those subjects that I think I know well. So I have tried hard to make this book understandable to anybody who wants to write real WML sites for WAP devices, or for anybody who just wants to know what Ã¢â‚¬Å“this WAP thingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is all about.\nI have also found that being interested in different fields can provide unlooked for solutions to problems that come up every day. Who would\nhave thought that knowing WML for devices with small screens would\nmake me reexamine the way IwriteHTMLfor Internet web sites every day?\nWho would have thought ten years ago that knowing how to code in C\nwould make picking up WMLScript so easy? Or that getting a basic understanding of XML and how it works would make WML such a breeze to\nwork with?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9884690b9cabfb918be98a32be4c87f942a5591","amp;dn":"Wap+For+Beginners","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9884690b9cabfb918be98a32be4c87f942a5591","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,136,70,144,185,202,191,185,24,190,152,163,43,228,200,127,148,42,85,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
