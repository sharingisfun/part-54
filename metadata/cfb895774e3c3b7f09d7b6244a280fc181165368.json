Brother and sister Sarah and Gert Bettens form the nucleus of the group, offering a gentle, folk-influenced sound that has produced numerous albums, and a lot of critical acclaim. Their touring schedule has seen them play with luminaries such as The Indigo Girls, Morphine, and The Proclaimers, and their recorded work has seen them work with Pixies producer Gil Norton. This release offers an overview of the first 10 years of their career, with a selection of music videos from Sarah and Gert that have rarely been aired, but offer a touching visual complement to their music.
