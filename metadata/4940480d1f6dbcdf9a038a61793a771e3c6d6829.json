It is the first \nconsole-exclusive game designed by Yu Suzuki.\n\nThe game is part of the Sega Genesis Collection for the PlayStation 2 and \nPlayStation Portable. It was released on the Wii\\&amp;#039;s Virtual Console in Japan on \n27 February 2007, in Europe on 2 March 2007 and in North America on 5 March \n2007.\n\n\nSword of Vermilion is about the role of Erik\\&amp;#039;s son, who takes on a quest of \nrevenge to defeat Tsarkon and free the world of Vermilion from evil.\n\nIn the town of Excalabria the people went about their business, and tended to \nthe fields. One day, vicious fighting broke out everywhere as the army from \nCartahena, led by the wizard-king Tsarkon, swarmed all over the town. The \ntownsmen were overwhelmed. The castle of King Erik V collapsed. Summoning his \nbravest, strongest and most faithful warrior, Blade. He gave his infant son and \nan ancient family heirloom, the ring of wisdom, to Blade. He ordered Blade to \nsave himself and the child while the castle burned. Blade traveled to a small \nvillage named Wyclif, where he settled down and raised the child as his own son. \nEighteen years later, the son of Erik begins his quest.\n\nThe Sword of Vermilion becomes the most powerful weapon at the end of the game. \nErik\\&amp;#039;s son saves the world of Vermilion and fulfills the prophecy of the Malaga \nfortune tellers.\n\n\nThe gameplay features different views and play style to break away from the more \ntraditional RPGs at the time.\n\n**  The Town View would utilize the typical overhead angle found in most RPGs. \nThis is the only view where you can\\&amp;#039;t view your status during gameplay. \n**  The Battle View would be a tilt overhead view where the player takes full \ncontrol of the character in real-time combat action. You can use your weapons \nand magic. There is nothing that is menu-based. \n**  The Dungeon View would be in a first person perspective where an array of \nsprites represent the maze corridors\\&amp;#039; walls. The view was likely influenced by \nPhantasy Star or Ultima. \n**  The Boss View puts you up against a boss resembling a platform game. \n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\n[Includes]\nSword Of Vermillion\nFusion (Sega emulator)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n1)Unrar\n2)Launch Fusion.exe\n3)Go to File//Load Genesis ROM//Select Sword of Vermillion\n4)Enjoy this classic :-)\n\nNote: When using Fusion.exe you can toggle Fullscreen with Esc\n      \\&quot;A and B\\&quot; is \\&quot;S and D\\&quot; for controls.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4940480d1f6dbcdf9a038a61793a771e3c6d6829","amp;dn":"Sword+of+Vermillion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4940480d1f6dbcdf9a038a61793a771e3c6d6829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,64,72,13,31,109,188,223,154,3,138,97,121,58,119,30,60,109,104,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
