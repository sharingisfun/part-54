After narrowly \nescaping a fire that consumes a Danish museum, Cotton Malone?former U.S. \nJustice Department agent turned rare-book dealer?learns from his friend, \nthe beguiling adventurer Cassiopeia Vitt, that the blaze was part of a \ncampaign of arson intended to mask a far more diabolical design.\n\nFrom the ashes of the U.S.S.R., a new nation has arisen: the Central Asian \nFederation. At its helm is Supreme Minister Irina Zovastina, a cunning despot \nwith the single-minded desire to surpass Alexander the Great as history&amp;#039;s \nultimate conqueror. The Federation has amassed a harrowing arsenal of \nbiological weapons, and only one thing keeps Zovastina from setting in motion \nher death march of domination: a miraculous healing serum, kept secret by an \nancient puzzle and buried with the mummified remains of Alexander the \nGreat?in a tomb lost to the ages for more than 1,500 years.\n\nTogether, Cotton and Cassiopeia must outrun and outthink the forces allied \nagainst them in order to unravel a riddle whose solution could destroy or save \nmillions of people?depending on who finds the lost tomb first.\n\n----\n\nSteve Berry is the New York Times bestselling author of The Alexandria Link, \nThe Templar Legacy, The Third Secret, The Romanov Prophecy, and The \nAmber Room.
