One is sentenced to death and must wait in the custody of the captain of the island&amp;#039;s guard until a guillotine can arrive from Martinique. During the months of waiting, the convict Neel Auguste becomes the protÃƒÂ©gÃƒÂ© of the captain&amp;#039;s wife, Madame La. As she guides Neel to redemption through good works, sobriety, and study, the men of the small French elite who govern the islands criticize the captain for the latitude he gives his wife. He offends them further through his extraordinary love for her, his abrupt manner, and his growing defense of Neel. What will he do when the guillotine arrives?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81d4cfcec5418437805654d47da4fb60e3591282","amp;dn":"La+veuve+de+Saint+Pierre","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81d4cfcec5418437805654d47da4fb60e3591282","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,212,207,206,197,65,132,55,128,86,84,212,125,164,251,96,227,89,18,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
