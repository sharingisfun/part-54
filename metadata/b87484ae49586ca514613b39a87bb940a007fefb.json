During the next 14 days they made 5 songs, which were put on a demo cd entitled &quot;SOGPTU&quot; - the title was chosen because it was stupid! After some time the debut album &quot;Warum?&quot; was released on Eraser/Novatekk. Next was the &quot;Love&quot; EP/Mini-Album thing was scheduled to be released in Oct./Nov. 1999, but due to several mishaps, live shows, delays, broken switches, and other stuff (classified) it was Re-Scheduled to Feb./Mar. 2000. \n\nAfter two years of no released material Der Doktor was kicked out of Arzt+Pfusch in August of 2002. Shortly afterwards Cymonk (from the german project Cymotec) joined A+P. \n\nThe process of writing new (&amp; interesting??) material has started in the beginning of 2003-06 &amp; so the (oh so splendid) future can&amp;#039;t look any brighter! \n\n&quot;NoisEbmStupidEvilDustrial&quot; \n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b87484ae49586ca514613b39a87bb940a007fefb","amp;dn":"Arzt%2BPfusch+-+S.I.C.K.+%282007%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b87484ae49586ca514613b39a87bb940a007fefb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,116,132,174,73,88,108,165,20,97,59,57,168,123,185,64,160,7,254,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
