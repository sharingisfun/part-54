When Dayanand Dixit refuses to sell his property to Verma, Ghulam is asked to move into their house, live with them, and eventually force them to leave. Dayanand and his wife, Bhagyalaxmi, are shocked at this and initially cannot accept a Muslim male to live together with them and eat from their utensils. To make matters worse, Dayanand loses his job, his son, Vikram, is unable to secure admission in any college, and their daughter, Vidya, is unable to get anyone to marry her. Faced with these obstacles, the Dixit family must now arrive at a compromise with Ghulam and his masters - or else be shunned by the rest of the community - leaving Vikram uneducated and Vidya unmarried for life.\n\nTank Joo Kom Agayn !!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c9c8432a1e619871e89ff2d5d615d33a732157af","amp;dn":"Ghulam-E-Musthafa.1997+%5Bwacky_p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c9c8432a1e619871e89ff2d5d615d33a732157af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[201,200,67,42,30,97,152,113,232,159,242,213,214,21,211,58,115,33,87,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
