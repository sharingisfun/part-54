What Roy doesn&amp;#039;t realize is that the satellite is a soul-collecting route to Hell. During an argument one night, Roy and Helen are sucked into a warped version of cable TV - 666 channels of bizarre programs, each designed to collect the souls of Spike&amp;#039;s customers. Roy &amp; Helen find themselves caught up in shows such as &quot;You Can&amp;#039;t Win&quot; (a game show), &quot;Northern OverExposure&quot;, &quot;Driving Over Miss Daisy&quot; and a cartoon sequence called &quot;RoboCat&quot;, as well as &quot;Duane&amp;#039;s Underworld&quot; and &quot;HTV&quot;. When Roy makes it through the trial period without losing his soul, Spike discharges him, but keeps Helen hostage. Now Roy must re-enter this bizarre world of Hell Vision TV if he ever wants to see Helen again.\n\nSTAY TUNED(IMDB Link) &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105466/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105466/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRun Time = 1:28:18\n\nVIDEO\nCodec = H.264 \nContainer = MP4\nResolution = 688X384\nkbps = 1030\nAUDIO\nMPEG-4 AAC LC\n48000Hz  157 kb/s tot , stereo (2/0)\n[color=&quot;#FF0000&quot;]\nRATED PG[/color]\n\n\nFile Size = 749MB\nHASH: 6FDA292A2C510579D912DD5CD78CE56B2A6D78DF\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6fda292a2c510579d912dd5cd78ce56b2a6d78df","amp;dn":"Stay+Tuned","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6fda292a2c510579d912dd5cd78ce56b2a6d78df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,218,41,42,44,81,5,121,217,18,221,92,215,140,229,107,42,109,120,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
