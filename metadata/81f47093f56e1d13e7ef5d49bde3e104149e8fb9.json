The show was met with \n\nsurprisingly high acclaim and viewership, and everyone and \ntheir brother signed up for an &quot;acoustic&quot; session. \nVery Best of MTV Unplugged compiles some of the series most\nlauded moments, most notably Eric Clapton&amp;#039;s smash performance\nof &quot;Tears in Heaven.&quot; However, this is by no means a complete\ndocument of the sheer depth of talent that the show has provided\nover the years, nor is it indicative of the diversity that has been \nshowcased. Aside from R.E.M., many notable performances from\nthe show&amp;#039;s early years (which featured, among others, the Cure \nand 10,000 Maniacs with their memorable rendition of &quot;Because the Night&quot;) \nare conspicuously absent from the disc, as well as performances from the \nlandmark Unplugged hip-hop sessions. Those issues aside, memorable\nperformances do abound here, from some of the most important \nnames in the history of pop music. \n\nHAVE YOU FOUND YOUR DARKSIDE....... !\n\nMorphius@Darkside...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81f47093f56e1d13e7ef5d49bde3e104149e8fb9","amp;dn":"The+Very+Best+of+MTV+Unplugged+++Volume+1+++mp3+with+covers","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81f47093f56e1d13e7ef5d49bde3e104149e8fb9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,244,112,147,245,110,29,19,231,239,93,73,189,227,225,4,20,158,143,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
