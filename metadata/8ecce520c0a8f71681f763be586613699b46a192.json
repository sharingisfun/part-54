Most stories were set in World War II, with some based on other conflicts.\n\nIn 1974, in response to the success of the D. C. Thomson &amp; Co. Ltd war comic Warlord, IPC hired freelance writers Pat Mills and John Wagner to develop a rival title. Mills and Wagner brought in fellow freelancer Gerry Finley-Day to help develop stories. When the title proved a success, Mills went on to create Action and 2000 AD, while Wagner was asked to revive Valiant. The attempts to breathe new life into Valiant were unsuccessful, and it was merged with Battle in October 1976.[1] For some time afterwards the merged comic was entitled Battle Picture Weekly and Valiant. Action also merged with Battle on 19 November 1977, the resulting comic being named Battle Action. In 1982 the comic was retitled again, to Battle.\n\nA notable feature of the comic, suited to its era of circulation, was its letters page with readers sending in stories of their fathers&amp;#039; and grandfathers&amp;#039; exploits during the Great War and WWII, often in an effort to win a nominal &amp;#039;star letter&amp;#039; prize.\n\nSee also:\n\nComicsuk.co.uk\nBest of Battle at sevenpennynightmare.co.uk\n\n\nCategory:\tComics\nSize:\t511.86 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\nFile Name \tSize\nBattle Picture Library 1047 [1976] (MF).cbz \t20.65 MB\nBattle Picture Library 1193 [1978] (Zeg).cbz \t15.41 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 001 [1975-03-08] (gavbie).cbz \t11.19 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 002 [1975-03-15] (gavbie).cbz \t10.54 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 003 [1975-03-22] (gavbie).cbz \t10.83 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 004 [1975-03-29] (gavbie).cbz \t11.22 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 005 [1975-04-05] (gavbie).cbz \t26.40 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 006 [1975-04-12] (gavbie).cbz \t26.74 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 007 [1975-04-19] (gavbie).cbz \t11.06 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 008 [1975-04-26] (gavbie).cbz \t10.74 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 009 [1975-05-03] (gavbie).cbz \t10.60 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 010 [1975-05-10] (gavbie).cbz \t11.09 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 011 [1975-05-17] (gavbie).cbz \t11.20 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 012 [1975-05-24] (gavbie).cbz \t10.94 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 013 [1975-05-31] (gavbie).cbz \t10.82 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 014 [1975-06-07] (gavbie).cbz \t10.93 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 015 [1975-06-14] (gavbie).cbz \t10.60 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 016 [1975-06-21] (gavbie).cbz \t11.45 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 017 [1975-06-28] (gavbie).cbz \t10.69 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 018 [1975-07-05] (gavbie).cbz \t10.73 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 019 [1975-07-12] (gavbie).cbz \t11.45 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 020 [1975-07-19] (gavbie).cbz \t10.85 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 021 [1975-07-26] (gavbie).cbz \t11.55 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 022 [1975-08-02] (gavbie).cbz \t10.77 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 023 [1975-08-09] (gavbie).cbz \t10.73 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 024 [1975-08-16] (gavbie).cbz \t11.53 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 025 [1975-08-23] (gavbie).cbz \t10.85 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 026 [1975-08-30] (neercs).cbr \t14.94 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 027 [1975-09-06] (neercs).cbr \t14.66 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 030 [1975-09-27] (neercs).cbr \t14.67 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 031 [1975-10-04] (neercs).cbr \t18.71 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 032 [1975-10-11] (neercs).cbr \t18.88 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 033 [1975-10-18] (neercs).cbr \t14.07 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 034 [1975-10-25] (neercs).cbr \t26.57 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 035 [1975-11-01] (neercs).cbr \t26.38 MB\nBattle Picture Weekly 036 [1975-11-08] (neercs).cbr \t21.42 MB","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ecce520c0a8f71681f763be586613699b46a192","amp;dn":"Battle+Picture+Weekly","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ecce520c0a8f71681f763be586613699b46a192","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,204,229,32,192,168,247,22,129,247,99,190,88,102,19,105,155,70,161,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
