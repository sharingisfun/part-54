Meanwhile, Spike considers changing sides as this hellish new status quo presents some opportunities he can&amp;#039;t pass up. And we promise a shock ending more explosive than even those of the first three issues. Joss Whedon, Brian Lynch and Franco Urru continue their march through a Los Angeles truly gone to hell.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:29a20f38df68514d7e3696817ab3546e8ed3be23","amp;dn":"Angel+After+The+Fall+%234+Comic+%28Newest%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"29a20f38df68514d7e3696817ab3546e8ed3be23","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,162,15,56,223,104,81,77,126,54,150,129,122,179,84,110,142,211,190,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
