Provocation and the unexpected was their trademark, and the result was quite enormous.\nFor their performance (musical and art) at the I.C.A. , the public reaction (or rather the press's reaction) was that of shock. Members of the parliament expressed their outraged views in the press, calling Throbbing Gristle 'sick people', 'wreckers of civilization' and worse. This gave Throbbing Gristle a lot of publicity, and enabled them to get more gigs.\nThe band used synthesizers, guitars, lots of pedaleffects, bass guitar, tape cut ups, cornet, and presented a very varied, but mostly noisy, soundpicture. They used digital samplers before any Fairlights were built, and Chris built a lot of other electronic equipment to form the very special sound of TG.\nMost of the songs were made directly, unrehearsed on stage and was rarely remixed when the records were made. Even the studio material is mostly 'live'.\nThe music range from ambient synth, to really harsh guitar-bashing, to 'nice' pop tunes, but they all have the pure energy of enthusiasm and experimentation.\nThe last recordings are dated 1981, and that's when TG ceased to exist as a group. \n\nGenesis has been involved in the group 'Psychic TV' ever since the break-up of TG. He now lives in the U.S.A, since he got exiled from Great Britain. \n\nChris has made music in his own name, 'Cris Carter', but also together with Cosey as 'Cris &amp;amp; Cosey' and 'CTI'. \n\nPeter was a part of 'Psychic TV' in the beginning, but is now involved in the band 'Coil'. \n\nCosey has made a few records on her own, as 'Cosey Fanni Tutti', but also together with Chris in 'Chris &amp;amp; Cosey' and 'CTI'.\n\nDetta ÃƒÂ¤r deras 3:e (1979)...fler fÃƒÂ¶ljer om intresse finns.\nkommentera gÃƒÂ¤rna.\n-ha kul- (hmm...)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3202dfa905f5993c1703c32efcda353a882aba87","amp;dn":"Throbbing+Gristle+-+20+jazz+funk+greats","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3202dfa905f5993c1703c32efcda353a882aba87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,2,223,169,5,245,153,60,23,3,195,46,252,218,53,58,136,42,186,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
