Rachel (Sarah Grappin) is a single mother seemingly devoid of maternal instincts. Abandoning her young child, she leaves for the coast and falls in love with a young woman with whom she starts a passionate affair.\n\nThe film won the Prix Italia award.\n\nA note on subtitles:\nThis film contains optional English subtitles I incorporated with the film, that will most probably show on any DivX-certified dvd hardware player (usually there is a DivX logo on the dvd front panel). To activate the English subs, press the Subtitle button on your dvd remote. Alternatively, you can watch it on your computer using a software video player. Simply load the enclosed, separate subs file into your software player.\n\nFrench audio\n2-pass extra slow conversion to DivX from original dvd.\n\nRatings:\n\nIMDB 7.6/10\n\nUser comment: 10/10: Difficult to believe this was made for TV.\nThe most chilling aspect of any villain is his or her normalcy. The more aberrant the behavior, the easier it is to dismiss their villainy. Normal folks doing bad things though is a bit more unsettling. We see their ordinariness reflected in the mirror. One such antihero is Rachel (Sarah Grappin) in Jacques Maillot&amp;#039;s superb Cold as Summer.\n\nAmazon customer review: 3/5:Disjointed, slow; interesting story. \t\nMostly, this movie was rather fragmented. Maybe that reflects the state of mind of the main character, Sara, and that story was good, but the quality of the film was very marginal. This theme was really well done, the tragic consequence of Sara&amp;#039;s disconnection from her rut-like life as a mother of a young toddler, was riviting. What makes it lesbian is her encounter with a random stranger... BUT, it just wasn&amp;#039;t developed enough...Worth a watch though.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b841e9e5eff36eeb619233d54363330fea17bb4","amp;dn":"%28Lesbian%2Fdrama%29+Cold+as+Summer+%28DivX%29+%5BFroid+comme+l%5C%27%C3%A9t%C3%A9%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b841e9e5eff36eeb619233d54363330fea17bb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,132,30,158,94,255,54,238,182,25,35,61,84,54,51,48,254,161,123,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
