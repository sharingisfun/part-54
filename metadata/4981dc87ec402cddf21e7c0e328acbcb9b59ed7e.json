The Matroska format supports chaptering, so you can skip\n   songs in the video.\n\n   Some media players (Media Player Classic, The Core Media Player,\n   VLC) come with Matroska support. If you use other players, you can\n   use the Matroska_Pack_Lite_v1.0.3.exe included in the /Extras folder.\n\n   Enjoy this high quality rip from -AJ-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4981dc87ec402cddf21e7c0e328acbcb9b59ed7e","amp;dn":"Evanescence+-+Anywhere+But+Home+%282004%29+%28DVDRip+XviD+AC3+Matroska","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4981dc87ec402cddf21e7c0e328acbcb9b59ed7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,129,220,135,236,64,44,221,242,30,124,14,50,138,203,203,155,89,237,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
