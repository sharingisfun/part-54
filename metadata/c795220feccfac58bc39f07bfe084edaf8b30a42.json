If you have broadband then just leave my torrents on at Ã‚Â½ the normal speed. You won?t notice when surfing.\nAlso be aware that it is easy to release lists of people who don?t upload afterwards and have bad upload ratios so everyone can block them and enjoy faster speeds. My favourite torrent users do it regularly so if you want to try using their lists, then read other users torrent comments.\n\nNote: Anyone who wants to insult people please don?t write on my comments board. I don?t care who thinks their clever and who doesn?t. Show some good will for others please.\n\nSpeed: Don?t complain about speeds until you have setup your network with www.portforward.com instructions?. + Don?t complain about free stuff. ;)\n\nTop 10 Vinyl: I have included the BBC Radio 1 ?Top 10 list.txt?. If you have another track from this list please take a few minutes to upload to mininova and soon we can gather all 10 vinyl ;) I will seed your torrent at 50k/sec.\n\nSupport The Artists/Labels?:\nPlease buy direct from the label/artist. I have spent about $5,000 to date on music.\nI own these tracks. Do you?\n\nBig Up!\nThe Milky Bar Kid","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c795220feccfac58bc39f07bfe084edaf8b30a42","amp;dn":"house+mix+%2B+hip-hop+breaks+%2B+lounge+3x2hr+sessions+-+radio+1+-+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c795220feccfac58bc39f07bfe084edaf8b30a42","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,149,34,15,236,207,172,88,188,57,240,123,254,8,78,218,248,179,10,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
