You can download winrar for free\nat www.winrar.com\n\n-I&amp;#039;ve deleted v1.0 from my computer.  If you&amp;#039;re still looking for that torrent you will have to rely on other seeders to keep it going.\nI&amp;#039;ve uploaded the original one to mininova, it should still be there.\n\nREMEMBER:\n\nAll credits go to the original authors for creating these applications.  Credits go to me for putting together this and uploading it. =)\n\nFebruary 24th, 2008.\n\nOh, one last thing, THIS TORRENT IS CLEAN REGARDLESS OF ANY FALSE-POSITIVES REPORTED BY ANY ANTI-MALWARE SOFTWARE.  I cannot stress this enough.  Read http://portableapps.com/support and you will see what i mean.\n\nFor those too lazy to copy and paste the link:\n\nFalse Positives - Some false positive reports occasionally pop up in different antivirus products in conjunction with portable apps. This is partially due to the compression and portablization techniques used and partially due to a failure of some antivirus companies to fully test their virus definition updates before sending them out to users. If you encounter a false positive, please test the file in another antivirus product before reporting the issue to us in the forums to ensure that it&amp;#039;s not an error in their software. Several companies make available online scanners for individual files, so you won&amp;#039;t even have to install software (virustotal.com, Jotti). You can also use ClamWin Portable. Thanks for your help.\n\nEnjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0cc8d005769e55f57bd5111ea8f662be8180fb1e","amp;dn":"Portable+Apps+v1.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0cc8d005769e55f57bd5111ea8f662be8180fb1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,200,208,5,118,158,85,245,123,213,17,30,168,246,98,190,129,128,251,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
