They help history along, giving it a push where it&amp;#039;s needed. He is a brave though not so intelligent human that was living as a pirate a few hundred years ago when he was chosen to be a Voyager. He travels by way of a gold pocket watch-like device called an Omni. When its light is flashing red, it means history is wrong. His job is to fix it. In the pilot episode, Bogg ends up in 1982 when his Omni, which is only suppose to go as far as 1970, malfunctions. He accidentally picks up 12 year-old orphan, Jeffery Jones (Meeno Peluce) and loses his guide book to history in the process. All is not lost as Jeffery is a smart kid with a good knowledge of history.\n\n01 Pilot   10/03/1982\nPhineas accidentally ends up in 1982, picks up Jeffery and their adventures together begin. First stop is Egypt of 1450 BC where they find a baby in a basket on the banks of the Nile. Next stop is war-torn France of 1918 but the Germans are winning the war. They meet Eddie Rickenbacher but the &quot;should have been&quot; WW1 flying ace has not even heard of a flying machine. Next stop Dayton, North Carolina of 1903 to make sure that Orville and Wilbur Wright stop bickering and fly their airplane.\n\nXviD/576x432/48min\n\nLeave a comment if you&amp;#039;d like to see more of this show! :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44a6b82d7a971002cedf33397af6277be2c01f56","amp;dn":"VOYAGERS+01+Pilot+%5Bretr%3Ftv%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44a6b82d7a971002cedf33397af6277be2c01f56","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,166,184,45,122,151,16,2,206,223,51,57,122,246,39,123,226,192,31,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
