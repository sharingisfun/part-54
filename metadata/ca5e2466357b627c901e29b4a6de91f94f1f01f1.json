Jack, who had been inactive since his wifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death more than a year earlier, was called upon by now-President David Palmer (Dennis Haysbert) to stop a terrorist plot to detonate a nuclear bomb in Los Angeles. While Jack and his team were able to save Los Angeles from the attack, President PalmerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate is uncertain entering season three, as he was exposed to a potentially lethal toxin via a poisonous handshake after a press conference.\n\nSeason three, which is set three years later, finds Jack, who has just spent several months deep under cover, returning to the Counter Terrorist Unit (CTU) as Director of Field Operations. The mystery of President PalmerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fate and its aftershocks will be revealed.\n\nThe series also features Tony Almeida (Carlos Bernard) now the Los Angeles Director of CTU, and Michelle Dessler (Reiko Aylesworth), his chief confidante in the organisation and introduces Chase Edmunds (James Badge Dale), a young CTU agent who suddenly finds himself not only looking up to Jack, but working alongside him as well. \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca5e2466357b627c901e29b4a6de91f94f1f01f1","amp;dn":"24+Season+3+komplett++6+stk.+DVD+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca5e2466357b627c901e29b4a6de91f94f1f01f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,94,36,102,53,123,98,124,144,30,41,180,166,222,145,249,79,31,1,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
