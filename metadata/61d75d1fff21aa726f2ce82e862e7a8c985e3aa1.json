The long awaited and\n             much anticipated Police Quest ]I[.  Is it copy-protected?  I\n             have no idea, but I assume it is.  Once again, as with Larry 5\n             we&amp;#039;re not gonna sit on our butts all day and play this looking\n             for the doc check.  We&amp;#039;re gonna package this puppy, get a copy\n             to our crackers to start working on it right away, and then\n             start distributing it to the pirate world.  Enjoy the ware and\n             look for complete dox coming soon.\n             \n                        BTW, call our VMB - 716-987-1151\n\n-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nGreets:       INC - Looks like your local UPS man was sleeping on the job\n                    again.\n            Razor - Wow, &quot;Razor-Dox&quot;, what an original concept...

It makes it easier to free up\n                    space when your hard drive gets too full.
