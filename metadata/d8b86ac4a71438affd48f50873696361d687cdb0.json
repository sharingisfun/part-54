They sound rawer in many ways. In addition, some of the songs are completely different from how they are played today. Listen to the &quot;Forgive Me,&quot; which is played at a much more languid pace, which makes the murder seem all that more haunting. On &quot;Shining Moon,&quot; Mike&amp;#039;s guitar riff sounds much more jagged.\n\n \n\nFurther, some songs haven&amp;#039;t been played in years. &quot;Captain Kidd&quot; is one, a song that appeared in 1988 and inexplicably vanished soon thereafter. Margo mentions having recorded it for &quot;Caution Horses,&quot; but despite its intriguing melody the band abandoned it. It&amp;#039;s recently appeared online again at the Latent Download Site as part of what would have been called &quot;Sharon,&quot; an album the band shelved.\n\n \n\nAnother rare tune is &quot;Dead Flowers,&quot; a Rolling Stones&amp;#039; song that appeared on &quot;Sticky Fingers.&quot; The group reworked the Stones&amp;#039; version, making it completely their own.\n\n \n\nThis is truly &quot;one from the vault,&quot; so I hope you enjoy it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8b86ac4a71438affd48f50873696361d687cdb0","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies+1988-12-03+%40+Clinton%5C%27s+Tavern+-+Toronto%2C+ON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8b86ac4a71438affd48f50873696361d687cdb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,184,106,196,167,20,56,175,253,72,245,8,115,105,99,97,214,135,205,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
