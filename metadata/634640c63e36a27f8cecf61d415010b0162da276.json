A serious but artistic work, replete with facts, graphics and witness testimonials. The official story carefully deconstructed in front of our eyes.\n\n\n&quot;Excellent.  The best of the 9/11 movies.&quot; --David Ray Griffin, author of The New Pearl Harbor\n\n&quot;WOW!  is my reaction to this movie.  Great insight into demolitions and what really happened on 9/11/2001.&quot;  --Steven E. Jones, physics professor, Brigham Young University\n\n&quot;A superb work and asset to the patriot community and America itself.&quot; --Aaron Russo, producer/director, America: From Freedom to Fascism \n\n\nPlease donate or buy some products so that a Part 2 can be made: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.911weknow.com/911-mysteries-movie.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.911weknow.com/911-mysteries-movie.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out my other uploads:    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kongdvd&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/kongdvd&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:634640c63e36a27f8cecf61d415010b0162da276","amp;dn":"911+Mysteries+-+Part+1+Demolitions+%282007+Edition%29+DVD+NTSC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"634640c63e36a27f8cecf61d415010b0162da276","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,70,64,198,62,54,162,127,140,236,246,29,65,80,16,176,22,45,162,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
