Nonetheless, she has gone on to make further videos. Many of the first videos she saw were by bluegrass artists, although Dan Tyminski has noted that the video for Thriller was very popular at the time she was first exposed to music videos. She has made suggestions on the style or theme to some videos, though she tends to leave such decisions up to the director of the particular video. The group chooses directors by seeking out people who have previously directed videos bandmembers have enjoyed. The director for a video to &quot;If I Didn&amp;#039;t Know Any Better&quot; from Lonely Runs Both Ways, for example, was selected because Krauss enjoyed work he had done with Def Leppard, and she wondered what he could do with their music. While style decisions are generally left to the various directors of the videos, many ?including for &quot;Restless&quot;, &quot;Goodbye is All We Have&quot;, &quot;New Favorite&quot;, and &quot;If I Didn&amp;#039;t Know Any Better&quot;?follow a pattern. In all of these videos Krauss walks, sometimes interacting with other people, while the rest of the band follows her.\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f577907823cb3aee0280a2f521fbdec6c3f31408","amp;dn":"Alison+Krauss+%26+Union+Station+-+If+I+Didn%5C%27t+Know+Any+Better","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f577907823cb3aee0280a2f521fbdec6c3f31408","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,119,144,120,35,203,58,238,2,128,162,245,33,251,222,198,195,243,20,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
