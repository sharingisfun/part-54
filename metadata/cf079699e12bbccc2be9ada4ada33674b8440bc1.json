He also used his Clavia Nord Lead for bass sounds and some bass sounds from the Korg Trinity, his master keyboard which sits in front of the large plasma computer screen in his studio. Mike also demonstrated his new found affection for software synthesiser: Native Instruments' emulation of Sequential Circuits' Prophet V, the Pro 53, contributes buzzy, cutting analogue sounds to much of the album, while Emagic's ES1 and EVP88 are used for synth bass and wurlitzer piano sounds respectively. Also used was an Akai S6000 hardware sampler and Emagic's ESX24 software sampler.\n\nBass Guitar - Whereas Tubular Bells featured the growly tones of a Fender Precision Bass, prominent on Tubular Bells 2003 is the thicker, more modern sound of Mike's Wal Custom bass guitar.\n\nElectric Guitars - For the recording of this album, Mike once again used the 1965 Fender Telecaster with which he played all of the electric guitar parts on the original Tubular Bells. Joining the Telecaster are Mike's usual partners in crime, the Fender Stratocaster (listed in the booklet as a '63, but which I've seen before called a '62 - it could realistically be either), PRS Custom and also his PRS McCarty thinline. His PRS Custom 24 is used to play sounds from the Roland VG-8 and I suspect also synthesised sounds like the bass in 'Introduction' and some of the flute and whistle sounds.\nSome guitars were played direct through Mike's Roland GP-8 guitar effects processor, but he also used his Fender Twin Reverb and Mesa Boogie guitar amplifiers for when a slightly less direct sound was called for.\n\nAcoustic Guitars - The steel string acoustic guitars which Mike used were a 1960 Martin 00.21 parlour guitar (which I believe is used for the melody line in 'Peace'), a 1985 Taylor K22 (a grand concert sized guitar with top, back and sides made of Hawaiian Koa) and an Ovation Adamas (an electroacoustic guitar built mainly from fibreglass and carbon fibre).\n\nMandolin - Many of the mandolin sounds on Tubular Bells 2003 come from Mike's Mike Vanden F5 mandolin. Some, such as those towards the end of 'Peace', are speeded up electric guitars.\n\nSpanish Guitar - The Spanish Guitar parts come, once again, from Mike's Ramirez 1A flamenco (1975) and 1A classical (1974) guitars.\n\nPiltdown Man - On the original Tubular Bells, the Piltdown Man part was created by speeding up the tape while recording, so that the pitch of Mike's voice was lowered when it was played back. This time, the pitch has been lowered digitally, and he has been joined by a second, more feminine 'Piltdown Woman'. It has been said that this part is in fact Mike's sister Sally - I'm not sure where this information came from; it seems likely to me that it's Mike again, this time pitched upwards (all manner of processing can be carried out on voices using modern equipment, such as the processors from TC-Helicon, which can allow a voice to sound higher pitched without the usual 'Mickey Mouse' type effects).\n\nPercussion - Acoustic percussion instruments used by Mike were a tambourine, triangle and cymbals. Electronic percussion came courtesy of a Boss Dr Rhythm drum machine (he doesn't specify which model - Boss have been producing drum machines in the DR series since 1979 - the original Dr Rhythm was the analogue DR-55, the latest is the digital DR-670), and the Roland XP50 keyboard. The drums on 'Caveman' could well have been played by an uncredited drummer, Thomas Simmerl, who did some drum sessions for the album at Plan 1 Studios in Munich. An alternative is that it could be a set of cleverly programmed samples.\n\nTubular Bells - After having synthesised/sampled bell sounds feature on Tubular Bells 2 and 3, the real bells return for Tubular Bells 2003. Used here is the same set (which Mike describes as being like a 'toy' set of bells) which Mike sampled for Tubular Bells 2. \n\nMike Oldfield plays...\nBelieved to be...\nGrand Piano, Glockenspiel, Electric Organs, Accordion, Synthesisers, Bass Guitar, Electric Guitars, Acoustic Guitars, Mandolin, Spanish Guitar, Piltdown Man, Tympani, Percussion, Tubular Bells. \n\nOther musicians\nSally Oldfield - Background Vocals\nJohn Cleese - Master of ceremonies\nProduced by Mike Oldfield, engineered by Ben Darlow\nRecorded at Roughwood August 2002 - February 2003 \n\n\n/Egon Korkhammar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cf079699e12bbccc2be9ada4ada33674b8440bc1","amp;dn":"Mike+Oldfield+-+Tubular+Bells+2003+DVD+Audio+DTS+%26+5.1-ZoM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cf079699e12bbccc2be9ada4ada33674b8440bc1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,7,150,153,225,43,188,204,43,233,173,164,173,163,54,116,184,68,11,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
