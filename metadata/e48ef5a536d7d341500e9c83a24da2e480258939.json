The following subjects are discussed:\n\n-Fatma Suslu (Leo&amp;#039;s still legally married wife) phoned up Hans Gaarder - a Norwegian journalist working with Leo - and instead of being reasonable with him she was upset and started ranting and raving to him. This hostile behavior of Fatma is not helping Leo&amp;#039;s possibility to settle upon an arrangement of he being able to see his son, Isak Rumi. \n\n-Leo states that Fatma is making plans to temporarily go abroad, Turkey or Saudi Arabia, taking Isak Rumi alongside of her, without Leo&amp;#039;s consent (something that would be considered illegal in countries such as the USA). Leo is very worried because of the security implications this has not only for Fatma but especially Isak Rumi. Leo is very concerned that she may end up in a situation where she would jeopardize the life of herself and Isak Rumi. \n\n-Leo has come to the conclusion that Vivian of Rome and Venice, one of the most active members on the leozagami.com forums, is indeed who he says he is.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leozagami.com/index.php?option=com_fireboard&amp;Itemid=57&amp;func=view&amp;id=54&amp;catid=9&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leozagami.com/index.php?option=com_fireboard&amp;Itemid=57&amp;func=view&amp;id=54&amp;catid=9&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-The statement Vivian of Rome and Venice, as member of the Leo Zagami forums, made is tough but true: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leozagami.com/index.php?option=com_fireboard&amp;Itemid=57&amp;func=view&amp;id=591&amp;catid=18#591&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leozagami.com/index.php?option=com_fireboard&amp;Itemid=57&amp;func=view&amp;id=591&amp;catid=18#591&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-Fatma&amp;#039;s outrageous behavior is not normal for a Sufi and is undesirable when having in mind her spiritual path and development.\n\n-Leo asked me to send the link summarizing the double fraudulent activity Fatma is involved in to the Norwegian authorities:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leozagami.com/index.php?option=com_fireboard&amp;Itemid=57&amp;func=view&amp;catid=28&amp;id=535#534&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leozagami.com/index.php?option=com_fireboard&amp;Itemid=57&amp;func=view&amp;catid=28&amp;id=535#534&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-I promise Leo to write Fatma an email alerting her of the precarious situation that would ensue if she were to go to an Islamic country, in the hope of discouraging her to actually do this.\n\n-Leo says that the Knights of Columbus, a Roman Catholic Military Order started in the USA, is gaining power in Europe and have taken over the British Priory of Zion, located in Edinburgh.\n\n-Since three years the Vatican has been expanding the influence of the Knights of Columbus to infiltrate Priories and Freemasonry. Leo knows who the infiltrators are, so he and his fellow masonic brethren know how to keep the Monte Carlo Lodge free from their subversive action.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kofc.org/un/eb/en/news/releases/detail/20096.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kofc.org/un/eb/en/news/releases/detail/20096.html&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kofc.org/un/index.cfm&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kofc.org/un/index.cfm&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-We discuss the possibility of the situation escalating from a Faida, or blood feud, into a total war between the East and the West.\n\n-The involvement of the Vatican in this whole affair. \n\n-Fethullah Gulen and Thomas Michel working together at Jesuit Georgetown University.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fethullah_G%C3%BClen#cite_note-19&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fethullah_G%C3%BClen#cite_note-19&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=136369&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=136369&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.gulenconference.us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.gulenconference.us/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.fgulen.com/content/view/1360/14/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.fgulen.com/content/view/1360/14/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=fethullah+gulen+thomas+michel+georgetown&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.google.com/search?q=fethullah+gulen+thomas+michel+georgetown&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-The apparent intended future takeover of the Vatican by the Islamic World and to ultimately subject the whole world to Muslim rule.\n\n-The fresh invitation Leo received from the Knights of Malta to attend one of their meetings in Moderna, Italy coming Sunday (22 or 23 June 2008).\n\n----------------------------------------------\n\nTech specs:\n\nRuntime 40m55s\nMPEG-1 layer 3 (MP3)\n48000Hz Stereo\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.leozagami.com/index.php?option=com_fireboard&amp;Itemid=57&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.leozagami.com/index.php?option=com_fireboard&amp;Itemid=57&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e48ef5a536d7d341500e9c83a24da2e480258939","amp;dn":"Phil+Interviews+Illuminati+Grandmaster+Leo+Zagami+2008-06-19+%281%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e48ef5a536d7d341500e9c83a24da2e480258939","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,142,245,165,54,215,211,65,80,14,156,131,162,77,162,228,128,37,137,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
