Has a lot of extra things\nlike Windows Plus does. Try it out if you are interested. This\ncomes with SP2 already in it and NO it is not homemade. Install\nit and see for youself.\n\n\nNukers: Microsoft.Windows.XP.Media.Center.Edition.Proper-FTSiSo\nis MCE 2004, not 2005.\n\n\n\nUse one of the following serials during install:\n*\n*\n*\n\nOnce Windows is installed, run the crack.exe inside of the /CRACK\ndir on CD1 to get rid of the 60 day activation.\n\nEnjoy :)\n--------\nPQRS-note: Seeded at 10mbits .se No I DONT KNOW what is fancy about this so dont ask, download and try or just skip it. And please stay and seed just a while so I dont have to deal with that?
