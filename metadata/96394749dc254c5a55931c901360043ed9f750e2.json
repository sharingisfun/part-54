What started as a few small principalities was shaped into an indomitable world power by the sheer force of its leaders. However, building the infrastructure of this empire came at an enormous price. As Russia entered the 20th century, her expansion reached critical mass as her rulers pushed progress at an unsustainable pace and her population reacted in a revolution that changed history. From the Moscow Kremlin, to the building of St. Petersburg, we will examine the architecture and infrastructure that enabled the rise and fall of the Russian Empire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96394749dc254c5a55931c901360043ed9f750e2","amp;dn":"La+construccion+de+un+imperio%3A+Rusia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96394749dc254c5a55931c901360043ed9f750e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,57,71,73,220,37,76,90,85,147,28,144,19,96,4,62,217,247,80,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
