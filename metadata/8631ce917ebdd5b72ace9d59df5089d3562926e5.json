The film will focus on the history and politics of the period during which Arthur ruled -- when the Roman empire collapsed and skirmishes over power broke out in outlying countries -- as opposed to the mystical elements of the tale on which past Arthur films have focused.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8631ce917ebdd5b72ace9d59df5089d3562926e5","amp;dn":"King+Arthur+Directors+Cut","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8631ce917ebdd5b72ace9d59df5089d3562926e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,49,206,145,126,189,213,183,42,206,157,89,223,80,137,211,86,41,38,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
