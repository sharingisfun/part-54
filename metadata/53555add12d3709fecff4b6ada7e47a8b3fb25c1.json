Concerning the September 11, 2001 attacks, the song gained critical praise, a Grammy Award for Song of the Year nomination, and the Grammy Awards for Best Rock Song and Best Male Rock Vocal Performance, and became Springsteen&amp;#039;s best-known song of the 2000s.\n\n\nThe song tells the story of a New York Fire Department firefighter, climbing one of the World Trade Center towers after the planes had hit. The lyric depicts the surreal, desperate environment in which he finds himself:\n\nCan&amp;#039;t see nothin&amp;#039; in front of me, \nCan&amp;#039;t see nothin&amp;#039; coming up behind ... \nI make my way through this darkness, \nI can&amp;#039;t feel nothing but this chain that binds me. \nLost track of how far I&amp;#039;ve gone \nHow far I&amp;#039;ve gone, how high I&amp;#039;ve climbed ... \nOn my back&amp;#039;s a sixty-pound stone \nOn my shoulder a half mile of line \nThe choruses are more upbeat in a sense, featuring a more pronounced drum part and &quot;Li, li, li&quot; vocal parts, but as the song progresses the verses trace the ever more dire situation. Images of fire engines and the Cross of Saint Florian are introduced, and then, &quot;in the garden of a thousand sighs,&quot; a series of final visions: his wife, his children, and all human experience:\n\nPlease seed after you download.......and enjoy!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53555add12d3709fecff4b6ada7e47a8b3fb25c1","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+The+Rising","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53555add12d3709fecff4b6ada7e47a8b3fb25c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,85,90,221,18,211,112,159,236,255,75,106,218,126,71,168,179,251,37,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
