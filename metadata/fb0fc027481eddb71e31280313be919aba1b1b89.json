I can't tell you what an unbelievable mix of blues/garage rock it is, even if you're not totally into that genre-I promise you WILL NOT be disappointed. This never leaves my cd player and my friends all play this at their parties (at NYU). The guitar and drumming beats are so raw and rough which is fantastic and is a great and perfect complement to Dan's smooth strong voice. Play this cd from beginning to end and you'll swear by it. The song &amp;quot;I'll Be Your Man&amp;quot; has Dan swooning you over making you believe he is singing right to you, but fret not you rockers because &amp;quot;The Breaks&amp;quot; will move you and groove you. These two hip guys know how to do things right and I can't wait for them to come to NYC!! Hear they are awesome live and I'm sure it helps that they are as attractive as they are talented! I say goodbye to MTV ... and hello to The Black Keys!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb0fc027481eddb71e31280313be919aba1b1b89","amp;dn":"Black+Keys+-+the+Big+Come+Up","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb0fc027481eddb71e31280313be919aba1b1b89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,15,192,39,72,30,221,183,30,49,40,3,19,190,145,154,186,27,27,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
