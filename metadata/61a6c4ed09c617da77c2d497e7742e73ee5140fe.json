The film's opening details her attempt at lifting a diamond necklace, which also happened to be her first meeting with gorgeous male thief Lok (Julian Cheung). They escape together and passion begins. However, three years later the two have gone their separate ways, and Cat has abandoned the life. But, Cat discovers that &amp;quot;whenever she tries to get out, they pull her back in.&amp;quot; Godfather clichÃƒÂ©s aside, it seems that the Russian mafia have kidnapped Lok, and want Cat to complete a job for them.\n------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61a6c4ed09c617da77c2d497e7742e73ee5140fe","amp;dn":"Martial+Angels+%28ntsc%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61a6c4ed09c617da77c2d497e7742e73ee5140fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,166,196,237,9,198,23,218,119,194,212,151,231,116,46,115,238,81,64,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
