Hypothermia can do no wrong. Hypothermia emits a cold, repetitive strain of black metal that is hypnotic, addictive and glorious in its simplicity. ÃƒÂ¢??KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ldÃƒÂ¢?? is the sound of a band on top of its game. ÃƒÂ¢??KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ldÃƒÂ¢?? is the eclectic SwedesÃƒÂ¢?? second full-length and is also the first official release of fledgling French label Those Opposed Records.\n\nEverything about Hypothermia is unrushed. Slow. Lumbering. Laid back. Lacking any urgency. The duo of Kim (guitar/vocals) and Nachtzeit recorded these two epic odes to all things frozen and forgotten in January 2006 and the album was unleashed the following December. The stellar BM ambience contained hereon was actually composed between the spring of ÃƒÂ¢??04 and the autumn of ÃƒÂ¢??05, so rest assured that these guys are not in it for the quick buck...\n\nHypothermia is chilled in every sense. Chilled out but also frozen to the fragmented core. ThereÃƒÂ¢??s a sheer malevolence lurking beneath the monotonous minimal majesty of ÃƒÂ¢??Svag Fysisk LustaÃƒÂ¢?? and ÃƒÂ¢??SvÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¤rtade PassagerÃƒÂ¢?? but the music wraps its cold embrace around you so gradually that you will barely notice. Hypothermia reeks of integrity and underground credibility. It evinces art for artÃƒÂ¢??s sake and is one of the most welcome breaths of fresh air to blaze across the northern sky in manyÃƒÂ¢??s the long year.\n\nAll Kim Carlsson&amp;#039;s music is worth tracking down and ÃƒÂ¢??KÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶ldÃƒÂ¢?? by Hypothermia - replete with awesome acoustic strumming, hellish harshness, delightfully seamless mood swings and a relevant atmosphere that most artists lack - is as wonderful a place to start as any if you want to get thee some genuine, deep frozen, uncontaminated, soulful black metal extraordinariness.\n\nEAC Lame 3.97 v0 VBR with log","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82c80820ea47f47a6e8096e835578b2ef684f7b8","amp;dn":"Hypothermia+%282006%29+-+Kold+%2ASwedish+DSBM%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82c80820ea47f47a6e8096e835578b2ef684f7b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,200,8,32,234,71,244,122,110,128,150,232,53,87,139,46,246,132,247,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
