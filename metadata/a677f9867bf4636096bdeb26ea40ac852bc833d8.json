These transmissions, recorded with simple household electronic devices, force us to question our basic notions about life and death and seem to confirm what many of us have dared to believe: it is possible for the dead to communicate with us.\n\nAll we have to do is listen.\n\nNow, for the first time, this otherworldly occurrence stands at the center of a motion picture paranormal thriller -- White Noise.\n\nUntil the sudden and mysterious death of his beloved wife, architect Jonathan Rivers (MICHAEL KEATON) considered himself a decent, rational man, one who would not ordinarily subscribe to any theories about communicating with the dead. But now, a stranger, Raymond Price (IAN McNEICE), has entered his life, claiming to have heard JonathanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife, Anna (CHANDRA WEST), through EVP. Fueled by his grief as much as curiosity, Jonathan soon finds himself swayed by RaymondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s claims, validated by the recordings of Anna as well as the testimonial of Sarah Tate (DEBORAH KARA UNGER), who herself has found closure with her deceased fiancee through EVP. Jonathan comes to believe when Raymond says of the dead, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I can hear them, I can see them and I can record them.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nThen, the unthinkable -- Jonathan himself captures AnnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s voice and image through recordings he has made; she has established direct contact. AnnaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s message: for Jonathan to save the future victims of the brutal psychopath who took her life. But his dead wifeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s communications are often fuzzy, challenging to decipher. And Jonathan, in his growing obsession with reaching Anna, fails to notice signs of impending danger, summed up by RaymondÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assessment of the souls who cross the divide from the other side: Ã¢â‚¬Å“They canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t all be nice.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWhat Jonathan hopes to be true is, in fact, possible: our departed loved ones can reach us... but if they can come through, who, or what else, can also come through?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a677f9867bf4636096bdeb26ea40ac852bc833d8","amp;dn":"White+Noise+-+2005++Xvid+%28incl+optional+dutch+subtitels%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a677f9867bf4636096bdeb26ea40ac852bc833d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,119,249,134,123,244,99,96,150,189,235,38,234,64,172,133,43,200,51,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
