Yet Bernard Cashman, a forensic expert at the Oregon State Crime Lab, finds evidence that indisputably connects Cohen with the crime. \n\nFrustrated and confused, Doug consults Amanda Jaffe, star of Margolin&amp;#039;s spine-tingler Wild Justice. Amanda and her father, Frank, are working on a case that seems completely unrelated: gangster Art Prochaska is accused of murdering an informer. When Amanda starts looking too closely at the seemingly air-tight evidence in these two apparently unconnected cases, people start to die -- and she discovers that a madman with the power to alter the truth is on the loose. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73d26cde2651827889019622c403c54f3689a77a","amp;dn":"Philip+Margolin+-+Proof+Positive","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73d26cde2651827889019622c403c54f3689a77a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,210,108,222,38,81,130,120,137,1,150,34,196,3,197,79,54,137,167,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
