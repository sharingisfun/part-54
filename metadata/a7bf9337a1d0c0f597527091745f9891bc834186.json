Who knows?..\n\nThe barrel distortion that gave me such problems last week is removed by using a built in filter for correcting (or simulating) lens distortions. You can find it in the image menu at Filters/Distorts/Lens Distortion.\n\nAs I have a lot of images with this error, I go out and write a special Python plugin to do this task. It?s not as complicated as it seems - I have a good template and the Web and Gimp give a lot of useful information. You can find the scripts used in this episode here on the Download Page\n\nThis is the finished Python program:\n\n    #!/usr/bin/env python\n\n    import math\n    from gimpfu import *\n\n    def remove_barrel_distortion(img, drw):\n\n    img.disable_undo()\n\n    layer_corr = drw.copy(True)\n    layer_corr.mode = NORMAL_MODE\n    layer_corr.name = &quot;Barrel corrected&quot;\n    img.add_layer(layer_corr, -1)\n\n    pdb.plug_in_lens_distortion(img, layer_corr, 0.0, 0.0, -12.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0)\n\n    img.enable_undo()\n    gimp.displays_flush\n\n    register(\n    &quot;remove_barrel_distortion&quot;,\n    &quot;Removes the barrel distortion of a Sanyo CA65&quot;,\n    &quot;&quot;,\n    &quot;Rolf Steinort &lt;info @meetgimp.org&gt;&quot;,\n    &quot;public domain&quot;,\n    &quot;2008&quot;,\n    &quot;&lt;image&gt;/Filters/Distorts/B_arrel distortion removal CA65&quot;,\n    &quot;RGB*, GRAY*&quot;,\n    [],\n    [],\n    remove_barrel_distortion)\n\n    main()\n\nYou find a similar program in this posting. There I have torn it apart and described all the parts. The Python for GIMP documentation and this website can be helpful.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7bf9337a1d0c0f597527091745f9891bc834186","amp;dn":"Meet_the_Gimp_Videopodcast_Episode_038_Python","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7bf9337a1d0c0f597527091745f9891bc834186","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,191,147,55,161,208,192,245,151,82,112,145,116,95,152,145,188,131,65,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
