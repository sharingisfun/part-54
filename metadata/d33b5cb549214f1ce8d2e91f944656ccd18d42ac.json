It is rough, and some of the tracks could be described as experimental, noise, industrial, gabber, as well as a few crunkified slowed-down beats to give the thing even more flavor.&quot;\n\nIt ain't background music, that's for sure, but I hope you guys enjoy it enough to send copies to your friends and seed it.\n\nThanks for your support!\n\nChange.\n\nDG2K","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d33b5cb549214f1ce8d2e91f944656ccd18d42ac","amp;dn":"Digital+Grampa+2000+-+Penny+Pony+Rides","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d33b5cb549214f1ce8d2e91f944656ccd18d42ac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,59,92,181,73,33,79,28,232,210,233,31,148,70,86,204,209,141,66,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
