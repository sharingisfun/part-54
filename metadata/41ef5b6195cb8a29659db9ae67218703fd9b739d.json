But what makes &quot;Jazz Giant&quot; special is that Carter&amp;#039;s bandmates are giants in their own right -- Ben Webster, Shelly Manne, Barney Kessel, Leroy Vinnegar and Andre Previn (in the days before he became a giant of classical music). There is also trombonist Frank Rosolino, a giant talent and a casualty of the jazz lifestyle, who was sadly underrepresented on album but holds his own easily with these other greats. In terms of the album&amp;#039;s songs, there are two Carter originals, &quot;A Walkin&amp;#039; Thing&quot; and &quot;How Can You Lose,&quot; and five standards. A final note, Benny Carter trades in his alto sax for trumpet on two tracks, and Andre Previn is replaced by Jimmy Rowles on a couple of numbers. Simply put &quot;Jazz Giant&quot; is one of the best straight ahead albums in all mainstream jazz.\n\nPersonnel:\nBenny Carter: alto sax\nBen Webster-tenor sax\nFrank Rosolino: trombone\nAndre Previn, Jimmy Rowles: piano\nBarney Kessel: guitar\nLeroy Vinnegar: bass\nShelly Manne: drums\n\n\nTrack listing:\n1.
