With then current employer Art Blakey, band mate Bobby Timmons on piano, Paul Chambers on bass and Jackie McLean on alto saxophone, the trumpeter abandons time constraints and stretches out on four, soulful, hard-bop compositions (the first and the last are by Cal Massey). These hard bop masters are constantly inspired by Blakey&amp;#039;s explosive grooves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d355c19e6448d5703bb717332d038b30f295860c","amp;dn":"Lee+Morgan+-+lee-way+-+1960+%28APE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d355c19e6448d5703bb717332d038b30f295860c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,85,193,158,100,72,213,112,59,183,23,51,45,3,139,48,242,149,134,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
