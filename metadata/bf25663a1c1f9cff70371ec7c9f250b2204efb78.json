It premiered in 1991 on MTV&amp;#039;s Liquid Television experimental animation show as a six-part serial of short films, followed in 1992 by five individual short episodes. In 1995 a season of ten half-hour episodes aired as a stand-alone series.\n\nAeon Flux was created by Korean American animator Peter Chung (also the man behind Phantom 2040, which used the same animation style as Aeon Flux). A live action motion picture loosely based upon the series and starring Charlize Theron was released in late 2005.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf25663a1c1f9cff70371ec7c9f250b2204efb78","amp;dn":"Aeon+Flux+%28Animated%29+M-TV%5C%27s+3+Disc+Set","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf25663a1c1f9cff70371ec7c9f250b2204efb78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,37,102,58,28,31,156,255,112,55,30,199,201,242,80,178,32,78,251,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
