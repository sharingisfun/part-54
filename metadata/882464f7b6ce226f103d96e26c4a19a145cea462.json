I have fixed some bugs and made the progress bars cooler.\n\nTL is a multi-tabbed browser accomodated especially for the needs of BitTorrent users. You can search several \n\ntracker sites simultaneously and browse them individually. You can of course add your own favorites. \n\nTL is - and will always be - FREEWARE! I have written the program for my own personal use and share it gladly. In \n\nthe program is information on how to obtain notification of future upgrades. \n\nThe file is not large, so please share it when you are done downloading. \n\nIf you have an older version (1.0.1-1.0.3) installed, the installation package asks if you want to remove or repair. \n\nChoose remove and then run the package again to do a fresh install.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:882464f7b6ce226f103d96e26c4a19a145cea462","amp;dn":"Torrent+Locator+1.0.4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"882464f7b6ce226f103d96e26c4a19a145cea462","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,36,100,247,182,206,34,111,16,61,150,226,108,74,25,161,69,206,164,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
