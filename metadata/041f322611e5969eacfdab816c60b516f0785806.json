We were asked if we&amp;#039;d come and play in this KISS Expo, we said okay and the next thing I remember that T. Putaansuu called me and said that &quot;...you&amp;#039;re not gonna believe who&amp;#039;s gonna come to the Expo as well...Eric Singer and guess what, you&amp;#039;re gonna play on that same stage with him!&quot;.\n\nHere&amp;#039;s 1h 23min excerpt from that night. I had to cut several clips away, even from this short clip as there were some people that don&amp;#039;t want to be seen nowadays without masks, that is! I don&amp;#039;t wanna see their lawyers anywhere near us and of course, the guys &amp; a girl want to remain anonymous, so I will grant them that and I will not show any of them in this video.\n\nPLS NOTE!!!! After encoding, I noticed that there were some audio/video clippings in this *.avi, but I will make a better release soon as I&amp;#039;ve heard that some of us has better quality material than I have. So bear with me!!!\n\nIf you want to contact us, please send an email to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d0a4b1a5bbbbb190b7bdb1b9bcfeb3bfbd&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; with &quot;KISS EXPO&quot; as a subject and I will respond as soon as possible. Thanks!!!\n\n\nP.S. Oh yeah, and THANKS ERIC and of course TOMI!!!\n\nP.S.# 2 THANKS KISS!!!!!\n\n- taukka - DEAR VICTIMS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:041f322611e5969eacfdab816c60b516f0785806","amp;dn":"Dear+Victims+%40+KISS+Expo+Finland+-98+with+Eric+Singer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"041f322611e5969eacfdab816c60b516f0785806","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,31,50,38,17,229,150,158,172,253,171,129,108,96,181,22,240,120,88,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
