In the film, Nakama Yukie portrays Oboro, the granddaughter of Ogen (Lily), the respected Iga clan matriarch, while Odagiri Jo plays Gennosuke, the son of Danjo Koga (Minoru Terada), the powerful Koga clan leader. While living deep within the mountains, the two ninja clans have honed their skills to superhuman levels. Unfortunately, the clans do not get along and are forbidden by imperial decree from sharing their techniques with each other. Viewing the two ninja clans as a threat to his scheme for total domination, the nefarious Nankobo Tenkai (Ishibashi Renji) plots to intensify the rivalry between the two clans. Nakobo creates a contest in which the clans are forced to choose five of their best warriors to participate. The battle, however, isn&amp;#039;t just a friendly contest - it&amp;#039;s a duel to the death!\n\n\nIMDB link: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0475723/\n\nDon&amp;#039;t forget to visit us at www.sharego.net !\n\nTotal file size: 768 MB\n\nTracker URL: http://www.sharego.net:2710/announce\n\nAVInaptic Report:\n\n[ About file ]\n\nName: Shinobi.mkv\nDate: 20/02/2008 00:36:16\nSize: 805,635,653 bytes (768.314 MB)\n\n[ Generic infos ]\n\nPlay duration: 01:41:48 (6108.074 s)\nContainer type: matroska\nCreation time: 20/02/2008 05:35:42 UTC\nNumber of streams: 4\nType of stream nr. 1: video (V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC)\nType of stream nr. 2: audio (A_AAC (AAC Low complexity))\nType of stream nr. 3: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nType of stream nr. 4: subtitle (S_VOBSUB)\nAudio streams: 1\nMuxing Application: libebml v0.7.7 + libmatroska v0.8.1\nWriting Application: mkvmerge v2.1.0 (&amp;#039;Another Place To Fall&amp;#039;) built on Dec 31 2007 20:13:50\n\n[ Relevant data ]\n\nResolution: 720 x 304\nWidth: multiple of 16\nHeight: multiple of 16\n\n[ Video track ]\n\nCodec ID: V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nResolution: 720 x 304\nFrame aspect ratio: 45:19 = 2.368421 (~2.35:1)\nPixel aspect ratio: 1:1 = 1\nDisplay aspect ratio: 45:19 = 2.368421 (~2.35:1)\nFramerate: 23.976024 fps\n\n[ Audio track ]\n\nCodec ID: A_AAC (AAC Low complexity)\nSample rate: 48000 Hz","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8492d83fb3acb458fad52f2b3d3199fcd7b605b2","amp;dn":"Shinobi+SeCtIoN8+%7BSharegoRG%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8492d83fb3acb458fad52f2b3d3199fcd7b605b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,146,216,63,179,172,180,88,250,213,47,43,61,49,153,252,215,182,5,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
