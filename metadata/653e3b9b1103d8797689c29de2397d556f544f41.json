(2006)\n\nBasicly in a random nights drinking session in the year of 1998 Der Doktor &amp; Dr. A-Funz sat down &amp; recorded a few songs. During the next 14 days they made 5 songs, which were put on a demo cd entitled &quot;SOGPTU&quot; - the title was chosen because it was stupid! After some time the debut album &quot;Warum?&quot; was released on Eraser/Novatekk. Next was the &quot;Love&quot; EP/Mini-Album thing was scheduled to be released in Oct./Nov. 1999, but due to several mishaps, live shows, delays, broken switches, and other stuff (classified) it was Re-Scheduled to Feb./Mar. 2000. \n\nAfter two years of no released material Der Doktor was kicked out of Arzt+Pfusch in August of 2002. Shortly afterwards Cymonk (from the german project Cymotec) joined A+P. \n\nThe process of writing new (&amp; interesting??) material has started in the beginning of 2003-06 &amp; so the (oh so splendid) future can&amp;#039;t look any brighter! \n\n&quot;NoisEbmStupidEvilDustrial&quot; \n\nLabel: Distorted Monkeys Productions  \nCatalog#: dmp002  \nFormat: File, MP3\n \nCountry: US \nReleased: Aug 2006 \nGenre: Electronic  \nStyle: EBM, Electro, Industrial  \n\nTracklisting:\n1   Devotion (2:22) \n2   Love (6:17) \n3   Sincere (2:42) \n4   I&amp;#039;ll Miss U 4Ever (5:25) \n5   Always (Ultra) (2:11) \n6   Affection (5:18) \n7   Faith Is (2:36) \n8   My Heart Belongs 2 U (5:45) \n9   Dedication (2:20) \n10   Seduce U (5:26) \n11   Stay True (3:24) \n12   Boneloc (Delight Of Friction) (4:07) \n13   Skumfuk (Drummy Dummy) (4:22) \n14   Boneloc (12 Days Drinking) (5:27) \n15   Skumfuk (Under The Pink Noise) (5:47) \n16   Boneloc (Virgin Experience) (6:40) \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:653e3b9b1103d8797689c29de2397d556f544f41","amp;dn":"Arzt%2BPfusch+-+L.O.V.E.+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"653e3b9b1103d8797689c29de2397d556f544f41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,62,59,155,17,3,216,121,118,137,194,157,226,57,125,85,111,84,79,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
