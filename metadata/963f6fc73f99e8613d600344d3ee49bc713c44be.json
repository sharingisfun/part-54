Suddenly, as a result of the prospect of billions of dollars in profits, Bre-X was transformed from a penny stock to one of Canada?s most sought after blue chip investments. But as Bre-X rose to be valued at more than $6 billion, things started to unravel. The problem ? there was no gold. This special presentation tells a story of greed, corruption and fraud on a global scale and also addresses the mystery behind the apparent suicide of the man at the heart of the scandal.
