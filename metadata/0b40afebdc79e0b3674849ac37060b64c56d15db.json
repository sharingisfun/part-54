ABOUT\n1. INSTALLATION\n2. USAGE\n3. RESOURCES\n4. VIEWS\n5. INPUTS\n6. CONTACT\n\n0. ABOUT\nUp2Date is a tool written for myself by myself which I used to find music albums I should get. I tend to listen to\nsimilar music but I don&amp;#039;t always know when an artist I like releases a new album. I made this tool to compare\nmy current list of albums to an online source to see if there are any albums I&amp;#039;m missing. After writing this tool\nI realised that others might find it useful so I cleaned up the code, wrote this file and released it.\n\n1. INSTALLATION\nThis requires PHP 5 installed to work, and you need to be able to run php files from the terminal/command line. On\nMicrosoft Windows you&amp;#039;ll need PHP 5.3.0 as getopt() is used, this version of PHP is currently not stable.\n\nYou&amp;#039;ll also need to make the main .php executable:\nchmod +x Up2Date.php\n\nThis tool also assumes an organised music folder as follows:\nArtist/Album/...\nFor example:\nMusic/\n|-- Foo Fighters\n|   |-- Echoes, Silence, Patience And Grace\n|   |-- The Colour And The Shape\n|   `-- There is Nothing Left to Lose\n|-- Guano Apes\n|   |-- Don&amp;#039;t Give Me Names\n|   |-- Proud Like A God\n|   `-- Walking On A Thin Line\n`-- Yeah Yeah Yeahs\n    |-- Fever to Tell\n    `-- Show Your Bones\nActually this structure is only required by the &amp;#039;inputs&amp;#039; I myself have created, if someone created one which reads\nthe meta data from the tracks and builds up the structure that way I&amp;#039;d love that.\n\n2. USAGE\nThis is written as a command line program, but the idea is that it can easily be adapted to be used as a web based\napplication. As it stands make sure you make the file Up2Date.php executable.\n\nRunning Up2Date without any parameters will give you all the options you can supply:\nUp2Date 0.95.4\n        -r resource_name        The name of the resource to use [=azlyrics_com]\n        -v view_name            The name of the view to use [=cli]\n        -i input_name           The name of the view to use [=filesystem]\n        -f input                The path to the file/folder which contains\n                                the input [required]\n        -h help                 Shows you this help message\n\nThe most basic way to run the program is:\nUp2Date.php -f /path/to/music/\n\nUp2Date will pick the default values for the rest of the options for you. If you want to pick a custom input_name,\nfor instance, that is done like this:\nUp2Date.php -f /some/to/tree-output -i unixtree\n\nParameters can go in any order, in fact, normal parameter rules apply\n\n3. RESOURCES\nThe &quot;resource_name&quot; signifies which class from the &amp;#039;resources&amp;#039; folder gets loaded, different resources will load\ndata from different locations. The provided resources are music_msn_com (which loads the data from\nmusic.msn.com) and azlyrics_com (which loads data from azlyrics.com). Each resource will be different, while\nmusic.msn.com may have a broader range of music is also slower to access (as it requires 2 round trip times\n(RTTs) per artist) whereas azlyrics.com only requires one RTT per artist but may have a smaller range of artists.\nThe default is azlyrics_com.\n\n4. VIEWS\nThe &quot;view_name&quot; signifies how the program will output the resulting data. The provided views are cli and xml. The\nformer will output the data in a newline separated and indented list ideal for reading in the terminal or piping to a\ntext file. The xml view outputs the data into an xml file, will suited for later parsing by other programs.\n\nAll views output the data to STDOUT, it is assumed the user will pipe the ouput as required.\n\n5. INPUTS\nThis &amp;#039;input_name&amp;#039; signifies what format the program takes the input in. The provided inputs are filesystem, unixtree\nand wintree. Each input has one parameter passed to it, the required -f parameter, what this parameter should\npoint to varies depending on what input was specified. The filesystem input expects the -f value to point to your\nlocal music folder, filesystem will then scan that folder for the data it will use. unixtree and wintree both expect\nthe -f value to point to a file containing the ouput of the &amp;#039;tree&amp;#039; command (either the windows or the unix version)\nwhen run on your music folder. The default input is filesystem.\n\n6.
