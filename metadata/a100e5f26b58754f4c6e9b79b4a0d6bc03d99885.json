One of my favorite nights of the season for sure.\n\nPeople like the non-joined files so I\\&amp;#039;ll do it this way so it\\&amp;#039;s easier to watch. I cut out 100\\&amp;#039;s of megs too so it\\&amp;#039;s only the best of, the rest is on youtube.\n\n28 files - 583 megs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a100e5f26b58754f4c6e9b79b4a0d6bc03d99885","amp;dn":"Big+Brother+USA+9+Live+Feeds+-+03-28-08","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a100e5f26b58754f4c6e9b79b4a0d6bc03d99885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,0,229,242,107,88,117,79,76,110,155,121,180,160,214,188,3,217,152,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
