Their poor uncle is ashamed of himself! There is only one chance to \nget their fat Uncle Francesco back: Earn loads of money, within 24 hours, with \nthe pizza restaurant ! \n\nEarning money requires a lot of work. After taking the order by phone, they \nhave to prepare the order in the kitchen, by preparing all the \npizza-ingredients (cheese, pepperoni, tomato, ananas, onions, etc, etc) and \nalso prepare other extra orders (fries, soda, salad). \n\nAfter finishing the pizza one of them has to drive in Kevin's supercharged quad \nto the customer: and here the difficult part starts! If the Pizza is delivered \ntoo late, the customer will not pay for his pizza. Because of this 'golden \nrule', all pizza customers will try to make your delivery as hard as possible. \nTheir loose (wild) dogs and many other obstacles will make you use your jump \nand run action to the max. \n\nCan you make a pizza and deliver it within time? Proof it.
