The globalists intend to gain, through any available means, total dictatorial control over all the peoples of the world. They cannot realize their goal if their would-be enforcers (police and soldiers) refuse to assist them in their treachery. Jack&amp;#039;s motto spells out this truth: &quot;If police officers and soldiers will not enforce tyranny, it will never be enforced!&quot;\n\nMPEG 2.0 layer 3\n16kbit, 16000Hz Mono\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3e79d17f197007f0fef1a3555a72ecceb8c67bef","amp;dn":"Officer+Jack+McLamb+Show+-+April+17%2C+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3e79d17f197007f0fef1a3555a72ecceb8c67bef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,121,209,127,25,112,7,240,254,241,163,85,90,114,236,206,184,198,123,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
