Good suppliment for an acid or mushroom trip. or just good to have on in the background at parties. i made this DVD about a year ago and it&amp;#039;s put itself to good use. i figure it&amp;#039;s about time to share it.\n\nThis torrent is in DVD format, was created with Nero Vision, can be burnt with Nero Recode. Runtime is over 3 hours long, with over 1000 still images that if in the right frame of mind you WILL wonder if they are moving. the music selection is of my own design. i guarantee you will enjoy this. 10 different menu selections so you don&amp;#039;t have to start from the beginning each time.\n\nI&amp;#039;m also bundling my album into this torrent. The album is called Welcome to the Afterlife by my project called Secretly Plotting Your Burial. We&amp;#039;re a two-piece acoustic project. very dark. If you have the capabilities of excluding files in a torrent, please don&amp;#039;t exclude the album. This is my way of self-promoting.\n\nif you like anything you get here, please don&amp;#039;t hesitate to let me know.\n\nthe band&amp;#039;s myspace is\n\nenjoy.\n-Jake.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c792bc49b0badc79e3ad6c17ef7e812e5c786c87","amp;dn":"Don%5C%27t+Press+Play+-+Homemade+Slideshow+-+Trippy+Artwork+pu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c792bc49b0badc79e3ad6c17ef7e812e5c786c87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,146,188,73,176,186,220,121,227,173,108,23,239,126,129,46,92,120,108,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
