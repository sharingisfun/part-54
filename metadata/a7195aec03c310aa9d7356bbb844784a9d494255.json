But it works very well, for Windows, Linux and (so it says) Mac. Granted I have not tried it on a Mac. :p\n\nI had trouble getting any of them to work. Till I found this one. Works great and is even customizable.\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7195aec03c310aa9d7356bbb844784a9d494255","amp;dn":"Warcraft+3+Auto+Refresher%21+%28Windows%2FLinux%2FMac%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7195aec03c310aa9d7356bbb844784a9d494255","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,25,90,236,3,195,16,170,157,115,86,187,184,68,120,74,157,73,66,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
