Living, breathing toons, that\n  exist in a completely cartoon-rendered universe. These toons go to\n  work, pay taxes, walk their toon pets and watch TV. The age of a\n  toon, or the particular part of the world that the toon comes from,\n  is apparent from his appearance and attitude. As an example, old \n  toons appear in black and white. Asian Ã¢â‚¬Ëœtoons appear in the manga\n  style. Certain toons are stylish and slick, while others are gross\n  and disturbed. In this world, some toons are politicians, some\n  collect garbage, some trade stocks, and a select few get work as\n  actors on cable television shows. \n\n  This is our game universe, where the most popular TV show is Cel\n  Damage. If you can imagine American Gladiator crossed with a cartoon\n  Demolition Derby, you get a pretty good idea of what the Cel Damage\n  show is all about. Each of the six main cast members drives a unique\n  vehicle, and all are playable in the game. The game action allows\n  for play styles that mimic the different competitive matches\n  presented to the TV audience. There are flag rallies, death matches\n  and gate relay races. All the play styles are aggressive, as each\n  cast member has access to a broad range of vehicular toon weaponry.\n  It is the unrestricted use of these weapons by the characters on\n  one another that makes the TV show popular, and the game action\n  exciting. And, because toons never die, it doesnÃ‚Â´t matter how many\n  times the cast members are blasted apart during the show\n  (i.e., in a game), they keep coming back for more.\n\n\n  We tested this game on a developer XBOX, and it works.  Since there is\n  no mod chip yet, we have no idea if this release will work on retail\n  XBOXes when/if a mod comes out.  However, now that there is a release,\n  a modchip developer will be inclined to get our releases to work, so\n  we think a future mod will work with this release.\n\n  If a game is small enough to be burned to a CD, you can burn it to \n  either a CD or DVD, at your option, using the same ISO file.  \n  The Xbox does not use media checks like the PS2. \n\n  When burning to a CD, if your CD burning program has an option, \n  choose &amp;quot;MODE1/2048&amp;quot;, exactly as if you were burning a PC CD-ROM.\n  We recommend PrimoDVD for burning Xbox for both CD and DVD, but \n  all CD writing software besides Clone CD should work fine.\n\n  From our experience, the retail Xbox can only read DVD-RW's\n  and CD-RW's, so if you want to be sure that these will work\n  with a future mod, we recommend burning them to Rewritable\n  discs. We have heard reports of the retail Xbox reading some\n  types of DVD-R discs, but we have been unable to verify this.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:54605205a89ba930cbab7811acfdec1d50615ff5","amp;dn":"Cel.Damage.XBOX.FULLDVD.NTSC-ProjectX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"54605205a89ba930cbab7811acfdec1d50615ff5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,96,82,5,168,155,169,48,203,171,120,17,172,253,236,29,80,97,95,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
