Willie Stark (Penn) is an ordinary man from a rural town, demanding that crooked politicians and shady businessmen in Lousiana be held accountable for the collapse of a poorly built school.

He then befriends a young idealistic journalist, Jack Burden (Law), who eventually ends up working for him. But when Stark asks Burden to dig deep for damaging information on an old family friend, Judge Montague Irwin (Hopkins), Burden begins to question his own morality and StarkÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â´s surprising transformation into an inflexible leader that will stop at nothing to remain in power..\n\nOther features\nInteractive Menus, Scene Access, Features: An American Classic, L.A.
