This greatest-hits package comprises ten of his best tracks, including the witty &quot;My Girl Bill&quot; and &quot;Cow Patti,&quot; as well as droll little gems like &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Fool Around When There&amp;#039;s a Fool Around&quot; and &quot;You Can Call Me Call Me Clyde.&quot; Many of Stafford&amp;#039;s double entendres may seem a bit dated by today&amp;#039;s standards, but there&amp;#039;s still some attractive playfulness hidden in the simplicity of his songs. Two of Stafford&amp;#039;s Top 40 singles, &quot;Your Bulldog Drinks Champagne&quot; and &quot;I Got Stoned and I Missed It,&quot; both from 1975, are absent from Curb&amp;#039;s compilation. \n\n\nP.S.
