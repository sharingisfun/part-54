But he is mistaken as a spy from a rival kingdom and forced to fight two Deadites before the people find out what he is here for. He also falls for a woman named Sheila (Embeth Davidtz) before he searches for the book. But after finding it, he says the wrong words that will allow the wisemen to use the book to send him back and stop the Deadites and accidentally awakens the Army of the Dead, led by his clone, Evil Ash.
