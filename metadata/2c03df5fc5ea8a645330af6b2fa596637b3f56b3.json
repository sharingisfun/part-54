His parents disowned him when he converted from Islam to Christianity.\n\n&quot;They told people I died in an accident rather than having the shame of their son leaving Islam.&quot;\n\n&amp;#039;Sophia&amp;#039; was living in East London when she converted to Christianity. She ran away from home, but her mother tracked her down and turned up to disrupt her baptism.\n\n&quot;My brother was really angry. He reacted and phoned me on my mobile and just said: &amp;#039;I&amp;#039;m coming down to burn that church.&amp;#039;&quot;\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\ndirect rip from RealAudio broadcast\n\nSIPR (RealAudio5) codec\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c03df5fc5ea8a645330af6b2fa596637b3f56b3","amp;dn":"BBC.R4_Could.I.stop.being.a.muslim_20080422_RealAudio.sipr.16kbp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c03df5fc5ea8a645330af6b2fa596637b3f56b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,3,223,95,197,234,138,100,83,48,175,107,47,165,150,99,123,63,86,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
