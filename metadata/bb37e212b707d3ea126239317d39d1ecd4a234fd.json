Many were \nthe tallest structures on earth, the highest buildings created since the \npyramids and until the Eiffel Tower; yet they were built without any of \nthe technological aids of the modern world and with little more than \nset-squares and dividers, ropes and pulleys, hammers and chisels.\n\nThe vision was to create a sense of heaven on earth and the medieval \ncathedral aspired to be nothing less than &amp;#039;the new Jerusalem&amp;#039;. \nSpectacular effects were achieved as this ambition was realised, leading \nto a revolution in design and a golden age for cathedral architecture in \nEngland.\n\nWho were the people who built them? What drove them? And just how were \nthey able to build with such stupendous skill, vision and ambition?\n\nArchitectural historian Jon Cannon, author of the recent, acclaimed \nCathedral, goes in search of the clues that shed light on how our \nmedieval forebears were able to realise such bold ambition. From the fan \nvaulting at Gloucester to the stained glass at York, from the solid mass \nof Norwich to the soaring elegance of the Octagon at Ely, Jon climbs up \nabove the stone vaulted ceilings, along the parapets, through the roof \nvoids and down into the crypts of the greatest cathedrals to find out \nhow - and why - it was done. \n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nFilesize.....: 599 MB\nRuntime......: 00:58:24 (87,600 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1297 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 130 kb/s (65/ch, stereo) VBR LAME3.97\nFrame Size...: 656x368 (1.78:1) [=41:23]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb37e212b707d3ea126239317d39d1ecd4a234fd","amp;dn":"How+to+Build+a+Cathedral+%28BBC+Medieval+Season%29.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb37e212b707d3ea126239317d39d1ecd4a234fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,55,226,18,183,7,211,234,18,98,57,49,125,57,209,236,212,162,52,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
