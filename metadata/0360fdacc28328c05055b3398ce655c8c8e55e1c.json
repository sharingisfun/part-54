He also misses  \n his dead dad, whom he thinks was Evel Knievel&amp;#039;s back-up. Rod, a man-child,   \n believes that he is a stunt man. When his stepfather needs an operation,     \n with help from his brother and his slacker pals, Rod hatches a plan to set   \n a school-bus-jumping record on his moped. First, his crew and he have to     \n raise money to rent the buses and build the ramp. Trouble is, Rod&amp;#039;s inept    \n at his chosen career. Looming failure is complicated by the return of        \n Denise, Rod&amp;#039;s next-door neighbor and secret heartthrob, who is home from     \n college. Is public humiliation at hand?
