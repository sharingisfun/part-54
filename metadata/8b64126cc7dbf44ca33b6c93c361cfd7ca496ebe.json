This was succeeded by a long string of consistently enjoyable Concord releases, of which this was the second one. This time around, she is assisted by pianist Stefan Scaggiari, bassist John Lockwood, drummer Colin Bailey and, on four of the dozen numbers, Frank Wess on tenor and flute. Sloane pays tribute to Lee Wiley on &quot;A Woman&amp;#039;s Intuition&quot; and sounds very close to Ella Fitzgerald on &quot;Sweet and Slow&quot;; she uplifts such numbers as Hoagy Carmichael&amp;#039;s &quot;One Morning In May,&quot; &quot;Baubles Bangles and Beads,&quot; &quot;An Older Man Is Like an Elegant Wine,&quot; and in a classic version, &quot;I Got It Bad.&quot; Recommended. ~ All Music Guide\n\nTrack Listing:\n1 Sometime Ago - 03:32 (Sergio Mahanovitch)\n2.One Morning In May - 03:46 (Hoagy Carmichael, Mitchell Parish)\n3.I&amp;#039;m Way Ahead Of The Game - 04:28 (Robert Emmett Dolan, Johnny Mercer)\n4.I&amp;#039;m Getting Sentimental Over You - 05:26 (George Bassman, Ned Washington)\n5.
