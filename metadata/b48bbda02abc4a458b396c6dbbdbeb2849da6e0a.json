I was blessed to have the opportunity to meet &quot;Bruddah IZ&quot; in 1990 when he was playing with &quot;The Makaha Sons of Ni'ihau&quot;.  Over the ensuing 6 years, I had the opportunity to speak with him briefly (on several occasions), hear him sing, and see that giant of a man strum his Ukulele dozens of times.  The man was definitely &quot;Island style&quot;, easygoing, and peaceful on every occasion as well as  posessing a fun and likeable sense of humor. \n\nIsrael's music is smooth, easy, and peaceful with the occasional funny or comedic track. The rhythm and melody are often enough to touch you even in his many Hawaiian tracks, whether you understand the lyrics or not.  This is not necessarily my favorite of his works, but it's popularity allowed his music to cross the oceans even further. \n\nI rank him tops in contemporary Hawaiian music of the 20th century along with other favorites of mine including: Cecilio and Kapono, Hapa, Willie K., Kalapana, Tropical Knights, and Ho`aikane.\n\nI left Hawaii in March 2007 with my Hawaiian CD's to keep me company back on the mainland.  It's amazing that in the islands, mainland news was slow to arrive, but on the mainland, island news is even slower. It wasn't until December of that very year that I learned that our friend IZ had passed away in June.\n\nIt is with great respect, admiration, and aloha that I share his music with you.\n\nEnjoy!\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b48bbda02abc4a458b396c6dbbdbeb2849da6e0a","amp;dn":"Israel+Kamakawiwo%5C%27ole+Facing+Future+%5BFlac%5D+%5Bh33t%5D+%5BLoC.+Blaze","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b48bbda02abc4a458b396c6dbbdbeb2849da6e0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,139,189,160,42,188,74,69,139,57,108,109,187,219,235,40,73,218,110,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
