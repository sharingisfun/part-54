Unbeknownst to him, in this hauntingly funny film by Peter Weir, his entire life has been an unending soap opera for consumption by the rest of the world. And everyone he knows--including his mother, his wife, and his best friend--is really an actor, paid to be part of his life. In this intriguing and surprisingly touching 1998 film, writer Andrew Niccol imagines an ultimate kind of celebrity, then sees it brought to life with comic intensity and emotional honesty by Jim Carrey in what may be the performance of his career. Carrey has exceptional support from Laura Linney and Ed Harris, but it's his show, in a portrayal that demonstrates just what kind of range Carrey is capable of. --Marshall Fine\n\n\n\nDIRECTOR-Peter Weir\nSTARRING-Jim Carrey, Laura Linney and more\nAUDIO-English\nSUBS-Nordic and English\n \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:caf36518f0538560c1ea1a15b5bb1c445332cab8","amp;dn":"The+Truman+Show+DVDR+ISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"caf36518f0538560c1ea1a15b5bb1c445332cab8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,243,101,24,240,83,133,96,193,234,26,21,181,187,28,68,83,50,202,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
