Ashley somehow seems to lead their relationship, not least because she has been openly lesbian for quite some time and having had several lovers. But formerly straight girlfriend Kisha also wanted to &amp;#039;go public&amp;#039; with their love through directors Mr and Ms Comstock filming. &amp;#039;Our love needs no argument, no explanation. If a person I know sees this film and discovers this about me (being in a lesbian relationship) there shouldn&amp;#039;t be any questions to ask about why am I this way. I&amp;#039;ll say: &amp;#039;You watched the movie, you tell me instead, why not?&amp;#039;\n\nShot on real film. Some of the fine film quality is even suggested in the DivX file. Runtime 53 mins approx. About half of it is their story told by them, the rest is pure and very sweet and tender, real love.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/dajpGaabE&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/dajpGaabE&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0c99697dc1291343bca73e4e943b0919ebc63401","amp;dn":"%28Lesbian+sex+documentary%29+Ashley+and+Kisha","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0c99697dc1291343bca73e4e943b0919ebc63401","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,153,105,125,193,41,19,67,188,167,62,78,148,59,9,25,235,198,52,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
