Dramatic footage of his recent attempt to climb \nPortland House in London is interspersed with film of his other \nescapades in Shanghai, Berlin and Moscow. Amazingly, as Robert \ndiscusses, he undertakes these feats of daring despite suffering \nfrom epilepsy.\n\nNote: Feel free to upload this elsewhere, but please include \nthis NFO and retain the original filenames.
