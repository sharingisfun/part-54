It basically allows you to play most games designed for the SNES\nand Super Famicom Nintendo game systems on your PC or Workstation. The games\ninclude some real gems that were only ever released in Japan.\n\nSnes9x is the result of well over three years worth of part-time hacking,\ncoding, recoding, debugging, etc. Snes9x is coded in C++, with three assembler\nCPU emulation cores on the i386 Linux, DOS and Windows ports.\n\nWith rom&amp;#039;s\n\nGames thats is. Im not sure how many but its plenty :)\n\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60060ec788b00986e00c053adc62343470e65617","amp;dn":"Nintendo+Emulator","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60060ec788b00986e00c053adc62343470e65617","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,6,14,199,136,176,9,134,224,12,5,58,220,98,52,52,112,230,86,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
