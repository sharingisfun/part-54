The album features 13 tracks\nand clocks in at over 73 minutes running time, offering\ndancefloor freaks and ultra heavy beat fans a disc that is\npacked with remixes and never before released material.\nBrimborium contains 11 remixes of tracks from Tohuvabohu\n(KMFDMs 2007 release), a remix from 2005s Hau Ruck (never\nbefore available on CD) and one new track (created from fans\nphone calls). The remixers include none other than KMFDM\nthemselves  with entries from Sascha K., Jules Hodgson and\nSteve White. Also featured are remixes by past KMFDM opening\nacts  Combichrist, DJ? Acucrack, 16 Volt and Angelspit.\nAdditional remixes by industrial music pioneers Die Krupps,\nfuture electronic superstar Velox Music and Icon Of Coil/Zombie\nGirl legend Sebastian Komor round out the high-caliber list of\ncontributors.\nBrimborium can be loosely translated as something with no\nmeaning or value, perhaps a comment on most bands approaches\nto a remix record, but not so with KMFDM! Aside from an all-star\ncast heavily reworking tracks on the CD, the accompanying\nbooklet features explosive new artwork from Brute! and liner\nnotes that tell the behind-the-scenes story of KMFDMs Fan\nPhone.\nBrimborium features double doses of Tohuvabohus most popular\ntracks, the title cut and Looking For Strange. The albums one\nall-new piece is called What We Do For You, a title lifted\nfrom a line in the bands hit song Light. This new audio\ncollage is built out of samples from some of the best (and\ncraziest) calls KMFDM received on their Fan Phone during the\nrecording of Tohuvabohu.\nKMFDM offers you yet another top-notch release that is filled to\nthe Brim(borium) and proves once again that KMFDM are the power\nyou can trust!
