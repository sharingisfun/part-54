He&amp;#039;s on to us.  No more hiding in the tubes.  From now on we can expect the campaign to avoid the gaffe&amp;#039;s and double speak as they realize that it may be recorded and played back later on said internet.  This shocking development could also impact the campaign as they investigate rumors that Democratic nominee Barack Obama is actually raising money on said internet.   A spokesman for the McCain campaign, on the promise of anonymity, claims that they will be unveiling a continuing series of other things the Republican nominee is also aware of. \n\nSpoiler alert: next up - mccain&amp;#039;s staff reveals he is aware of cell phones.\n\nat 4 PM Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR) will join us to discuss gas prices and off-shore drilling.\n\nat 4:30 Democratic candidate for Arizona Corporation Commission Paul Newman joins us to discuss his campaign.\n\nAlso try listening to Thom Hartmann,  Randi Rhodes,  Ed Schultz and Mike Malloy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fef66c421702e8bec13010df34cf7b85dca9ad5d","amp;dn":"Jeff+Farias+Show+-+June+25%2C+2008+%2824kbs+Audio%29.mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fef66c421702e8bec13010df34cf7b85dca9ad5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,246,108,66,23,2,232,190,193,48,16,223,52,207,123,133,220,169,173,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
