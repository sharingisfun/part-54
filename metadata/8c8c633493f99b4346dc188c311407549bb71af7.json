Perkins was aided by fellow naturalists Jim Fowler and Stan Brock. Shows covered a diverse range of topics from the lives of specific animals, their survival in natural and man-made environmental conditions, their relationship with other animals (both friendly and predator) and people and issues centering on animal captivity. Many of the shows were filmed in the animals&amp;#039; natural habitat (frequently Africa and South America), though some clips originated from zoos. The show ran from 1963 to 1971 on NBC (first on Sunday afternoons and later in prime-time). Reruns were syndicated to local stations in the fall of 1971, interspersed with newly-produced shows that were produced until 1988. \n\nIf you were a fan of Mutual of Omaha&amp;#039;s Wild Kingdom and would like to see some famous scenes like that of Perkins wrestling a python, check out \nwww.wildkingdom.com/nostalgia/video.html\n\nLeave a comment if you&amp;#039;d like to see more from the original Mutual of Omaha&amp;#039;s Wild Kingdom. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c8c633493f99b4346dc188c311407549bb71af7","amp;dn":"Wild+Kingdom+-+3+eps+-+Gorillas+of+the+Mountains+%28Dian+Fossey%29+%5B","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c8c633493f99b4346dc188c311407549bb71af7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,140,99,52,147,249,155,67,70,220,24,140,49,20,7,84,155,183,26,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
