New front side bus detection has been added to chameleon to allow booting on these systems. \n\nThanks to zef and Kabyl for the additions to Chameleon. \n\nThanks to eddie for leo4all. \n\nThanks to everyone in the OsX86 community for keeping it going \n\nEnjoy, \nJaS ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:55b903c9aa7eadc1aea76b0f651da280ce50ca5b","amp;dn":"Leo4All+v3+patch+10.5.3+by+JaS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"55b903c9aa7eadc1aea76b0f651da280ce50ca5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[85,185,3,201,170,126,173,193,174,167,107,15,101,29,162,128,206,80,202,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
