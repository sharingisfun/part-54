He plays with urgency and has a recognizably sour tone. Attempting to break away from stereotypical hard bop composing and playing around the end of the decade, he began to listen to modal jazz and Ornette Coleman. A bit later in the 1960s experimented with concepts from free jazz on albums such as 1962&amp;#039;s Let Freedom Ring.\nHis 1961 session, A Fickle Sonance, has still not broken away from bop, but has adventurous writing and playing, nevertheless. McLean has distributed the songwriting duties among the players, with two tunes each by McLean and Sonny Clark and one each by bassist Butch Warren and trumpeter Tommy Turrentine. (Note that some have attributed Clark-credited &quot;Five Will Get You Ten&quot; to Thelonious Monk.) It&amp;#039;s good to finally have the first U.S. CD release of this session.\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8a29bdd67362a7ae061395604af22bfc8d7636e","amp;dn":"Jackie+McLean+-+A+Fickle+Sonance%5BFLAC+-+LOSSLESS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8a29bdd67362a7ae061395604af22bfc8d7636e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,162,155,221,103,54,42,122,224,97,57,86,4,175,34,191,200,215,99,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
