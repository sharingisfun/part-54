The German officer, Lt. Christian Diestl (Marlon Brando), approves less and less of the war, while the American-Jewish GI, Noah Ackerman (Montgomery Clift), tries to survive the very bigoted military and Michael Whiteacre (Dean Martin) that starts out as a coward that tries to avoid the war, but becomes more and more blood thirsty as the war progresses.\n\n\n\nVideo: x.264, High Profile 5.1 @ Q21, 720*304 pixels\nAudio: LC AAC, 129 kbps ABR, stereo, 48 kHz, English\nSubs: external - Dutch, English, French, German, Italian, Spanish\nContainer: mp4\n\nI added the original advertisement from 1958. You can treat it as a trailer and see if the quality of my encoding satisfy you or not. \n\n\nSome technical aspects:\n1. I decided that I will not release 1 or 2CD releases anymore (or at least it will be something exceptional). I prefer high and constant quality rather than constant size, therefore I prefer to use quantizers. Do not afraid, the size will be not typical but I guarantee the quality will be good (Q21 AVC or Q3 XviD, whatever better)\n2. I prefer to use mp4 instead of Mkv (Matroska). I do not deny that the Mkv container is flexible, the thing is that the container is problematic if you want to reencode the movie with DVD Flick or other such tools. Audio and video is almost always desynced. I will use the Matroska container for special multiaudio releases (e.g. with director&amp;#039;s comments, etc.)\n\n\n\nEnjoy!
