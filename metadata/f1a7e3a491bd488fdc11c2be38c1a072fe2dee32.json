If anyone in music, could live up to. Australians love to cut down &amp;#039;tall poppies&amp;#039; and Fanny Adams certainly showed a lot of stork when they proclaimed that they were going to be &amp;#039;the best band in the world&amp;#039;.  \n\nThe band featured the mighty Doug Parkinson on lead vocals, ex Aztec and Bee Gees guitarist Vince Maloney, Johnny Dick on drums who played with Max Merritt, the Aztecs and Doug Parkinson in Focus and Teddy Toi on bass, who at the time was a music veteran of over ten years that also played in Max Merritt&amp;#039;s Meteors and the Aztecs.\n\nThe one and only release by the band before they imploded is an album of blues influenced heavy rock typical of a lot of English bands in the early 70s. It is not a bad album by any means and does have some excellent tracks but it does tend to lack spark in places and arguably this is due to the band just not having the songs.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.midoztouch.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.midoztouch.com/&lt;/a&gt; Ã‚Â©","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f1a7e3a491bd488fdc11c2be38c1a072fe2dee32","amp;dn":"Fanny+Adams+-+Fanny+Adams+1971","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f1a7e3a491bd488fdc11c2be38c1a072fe2dee32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,167,227,164,145,189,72,143,220,17,194,190,56,193,160,114,254,45,238,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
