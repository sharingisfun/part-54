If you are interested in listening to the Grateful Dead at all, get this album immediately.\n\nAmerican Beauty shows the Grateful Dead's transition from psychadelia rock to more of a folk-country rock. The songs here are smooth, calming, and really a pleasure to listen to. The band members work as a whole on this album and each song is a standout track. While none of the songs contain the Dead's trademark &amp;quot;live jamming&amp;quot;, alot of these songs are live favorites. The song &amp;quot;Ripple&amp;quot; off of this album is one of my personal favorite Grateful Dead songs. Fans of all genres of rock (or any music really) will enjoy this classic album. \n\nGrateful Dead\nAmerican Beauty (1970)\nCD to mp3 @ 320 kbps + covers\nApprox 97.5Mb\n\nTrax\n01.
