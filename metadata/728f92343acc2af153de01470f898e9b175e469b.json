It was after seeing the band perform on Valentine&amp;#039;s Day in St. Louis that I first discussed the idea of being the band&amp;#039;s archivist with Michael. The live CD, &quot;Waltz Across America,&quot; was made up of songs recorded on this tour, and includes the stunning reworked version of &quot;Hollow as a Bone.&quot;\n\n \n\nHighlights of this show include a raucous &quot;I Saw Your Shoes&quot; to open things up, a haunting &quot;Crescent Moon,&quot; and the lovely &quot;Five Room Love Story.&quot; For an encore, the band performed &quot;Dead Flowers,&quot; a fantastic cover of a Rolling Stones&amp;#039; song that they just brought back into rotation in January of this year, so if you are lucky enough to see them this summer, you might get to hear it!\n\n \n\nIn closing, I&amp;#039;ll leave you with Mike&amp;#039;s words about this show from the tour diary:\n\n \n\n&quot;The gig tonight was a bit of a rock show. We all had to get our ya-yas out since it will be a while until we are gathered together again. It was a fun night.\n\nThis has been a great year of touring for us. The Waltz tours have been the most fun that we have had on the road since we started out. A large part of the reason for that has been you folks who have embraced us so strongly and opened yourselves up to our music. Thank you, we are forever grateful.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:728f92343acc2af153de01470f898e9b175e469b","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies+2000-06-14+%40+Commodore+Ballroom+-+Vancouver%2C+B.C","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"728f92343acc2af153de01470f898e9b175e469b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,143,146,52,58,204,42,241,83,222,1,71,15,137,142,155,23,94,70,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
