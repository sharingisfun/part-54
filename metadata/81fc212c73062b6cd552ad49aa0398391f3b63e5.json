When Akbar accepts the marriage proposal, little does he know that in his efforts to strengthen his relations with the Rajput, he would in turn be embarking on a new journey ? the journey of true love? \nFrom the battlefield where the young Jalaluddin was crowned, through the conquests that won him the title of Akbar the Great (?Akbar? in Arabic means great), to winning the love of the beautiful Jodhaa, Jodhaa Akbar traces the impressive graph of the emperor and his romance with a defiant princess. \nWith Hrithik Roshan as Akbar and Aishwarya Rai as Jodhaa, this grand spectacle is produced by Ronnie Screwvala and Ashutosh Gowariker. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:81fc212c73062b6cd552ad49aa0398391f3b63e5","amp;dn":"%7BNaina+Shah%7D+Jodhaa+Akbar++2008++Pre--DVDRip++DivX+-Pakistani+Te","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"81fc212c73062b6cd552ad49aa0398391f3b63e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[129,252,33,44,115,6,43,108,213,82,173,73,170,3,152,57,31,59,99,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
