The album celebrates the 40th anniversary of BBC Radio 1. There are forty songs recorded by forty different artists (a little bit more than forty, since there are some duets). Each artist was given a year, and were allowed to cover a song from that year. The only exception to this was the Kaiser Chiefs ÃƒÂ¢?? since they were given 1967, they had to cover Flowers In The Rain by The Move, which was the first song played on Radio 1. The album was released on October 1, 2007.\n\nIt is to be noted that not all the years correspond to the original year of release, e.g. 1968, 1987, 1990, 1991 and 1992. The songs were however remixed and/or re-released in those years, so the fudge factor fits\n\nTrack listing\n\nDisc one\n# Title Artist Original artist Year \n1 &quot;Flowers in the Rain&quot; Kaiser Chiefs The Move 1967 \n2 &quot;All Along the Watchtower&quot; The Fratellis Bob Dylan (1967) &amp; Jimi Hendrix (1968) 1968 \n3 &quot;Cupid&quot; Amy Winehouse Sam Cooke 1969 \n4 &quot;Lola&quot; Robbie Williams The Kinks 1970 \n5 &quot;Your Song&quot; The Streets Elton John 1971 \n6 &quot;Betcha by Golly Wow!&quot; Sugababes The Stylistics 1972 \n7 &quot;You&amp;#039;re So Vain&quot; The Feeling Carly Simon 1973 \n8 &quot;Band On The Run&quot; Foo Fighters Paul McCartney &amp; Wings 1974 \n9 &quot;Love Is the Drug&quot; Kylie Minogue Roxy Music 1975 \n10 &quot;Let&amp;#039;s Stick Together&quot; KT Tunstall Bryan Ferry 1976 \n11 &quot;Sound and Vision&quot;* Franz Ferdinand David Bowie 1977 \n12 &quot;Teenage Kicks&quot; The Raconteurs The Undertones 1978 \n13 &quot;Can&amp;#039;t Stand Losing You&quot; Mika VS Armand Van Helden The Police 1979 \n14 &quot;Too Much Too Young&quot; Kasabian The Specials 1980 \n15 &quot;Under Pressure&quot; Keane Queen &amp; David Bowie 1981 \n16 &quot;Town Called Malice&quot; McFly The Jam 1982 \n17 &quot;Come Back and Stay&quot; James Morrison Paul Young 1983 \n18 &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; The Gossip George Michael 1984 \n19 &quot;The Power Of Love&quot; The Pigeon Detectives Huey Lewis &amp; The News 1985 \n20 &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Get Me Wrong&quot; Lily Allen The Pretenders 1986 \n\n* - features backing vocals by Girls Aloud\n\n\nDisc two\n# Title Artist Original artist Year \n1 &quot;You Sexy Thing&quot; Stereophonics Hot Chocolate / T-Shirt 1987 (Hot Chocolate Version) &amp; 1999 (T-Shirt version) \n2 &quot;Fast Car&quot; Mutya Buena Tracy Chapman 1988 \n3 &quot;Lullaby&quot; Editors The Cure 1989 \n4 &quot;Englishman in New York&quot; Razorlight Sting (musician) 1990 \n5 &quot;Crazy for You&quot; Groove Armada Madonna 1991 \n6 &quot;It Must Be Love&quot; Paolo Nutini Madness 1992 \n7 &quot;All That She Wants&quot; The Kooks Ace of Base 1993 \n8 &quot;You&amp;#039;re All I Need to Get By&quot; Mark Ronson Method Man and Mary J.
