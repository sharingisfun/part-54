We&amp;#039;re moving on from Gonzaga at this point, eleven days later, with a similar but different setlist, with HMMT and White Summer reversed, and the addition of four more tracks (in 11 days!) mostly from the first album.  \n\nThis show contains a curiosity that some of you (like myself) will find fascinating.  This is possibly the last time (and the only time that I can find) that Led Zeppelin plays &quot;For Your Love.&quot;  Robert introduces the song, to great applause, as &quot;something from the time of, uhm, Keith Relf&quot; and Jimmy takes off on a totally deconstructed, psychedelic version of the song that made Eric Clapton quit the band.  I don&amp;#039;t want to ruin it for you.  But this show is worth the download for this track alone.  The guys use it to close the show, and it&amp;#039;s devastating.\n\nThis is a tremendous early show, with Zeppelin playing their brains out and a pretty good recording besides - it shows its age, but we *are* talking about 1969 here - this is one of the shows that I wondered about when the thing came up about Bill Graham&amp;#039;s tapes a while back.  If Graham had a soundboard of this show, I&amp;#039;d give my left pinkie to get it.\n\nLed Zeppelin\nJanuary 10th, 1969\nFillmore West - San Francisco, CA\n\n2ndGen&gt;DAT&gt;CDR\n\nTrack Listing:\n\nDisc1:\n 1.
