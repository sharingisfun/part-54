The Xbox 360 edition was released worldwide in November 2007. The PC edition was released on May 28, 2008, having been published by Electronic Arts. The game takes place in the year 2183, with the player assuming the role of an elite human soldier named Commander Shepard, set out to explore the Galaxy on his ship, the SSV Normandy. In addition to plans for two sequels to complete a trilogy, BioWare plans to release episodic content via Xbox Live to fill in the story between each game, though these episodes are not essential for understanding the main plot line. The first of these downloadable content packages was released on March 10, 2008 for the Xbox 360 only. A PC edition of this additional content is due for release in summer 2008.\n\nThis release allows for the portable gameplay of the Mass Effect campaign, without suffering from the now infamous &quot;Star Map&quot; and &quot;Saving Glitches&quot; associated with early releases of this game. This release contains custom made icons. This release has had unnecessary content removed leaving it five-hundred megabytes smaller. Moreover this release has been customized to include several bug fixes, vastly improving overall game stability compared to other releases. \n\nAs this release is not a &quot;common&quot; Federal release it will receive no updates.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                              Miscellaneous Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease Note The Following:\n\n.I.\nThe Federation takes no responsibility for any damage that may come to your computer through the trial of this game. This mod has been tested to work \non Windows XP and Vista. No support or technical assistance will be provided. \nEver. Creation of this release took ten hours of unpaid labour. \n.II.\nAs this was not a &quot;common&quot; Federal release the Federation deemed it an unnecessary waste of time to create a modified executable file. The modified executable file used in this release was therefore made by the ViTALiTY scene group and the Federation takes no credit for its release. ViTALiTY has shown tremendous talent and skill in security reverse engineering. Their content was released without their permission. \n.III.\nThis game only possesses a single player function.\n.IV.\nI am ZKZ. \nI am an INDEPENDENT member of the FEDERATION group. \nProps to the scene.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 Install Notes\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSteps:\n\n(1.) Extract the &quot;MassEffect - Portable.rar&quot; file to a directory of your  \nchoice and then Navigate to the extracted directory (by default &quot;Mass Effect - Portable&quot;  directory. Double-click on the &quot;MassEffect_Mod-Crack_ZKZ.exe&quot;program. This program is not necessary as it only installs shortcuts (makes no changes to the game files which are already updated, modded, and cracked).\n(2.) Click through the installation instructions. Make certain that you install \nthe Mod-Crack to the &quot;MassEffect&quot; directory, which is by default located inside the &quot;Mass Effect - Portable&quot;  directory.\n(3.) Open the desired shortcut (which by default is) located on your desktop to \nstart the game. \n\nShortcut Information:\n\n&quot;Mass Effect&quot;                          - Game Launcher\n&quot;Mass Effect - Configuration&quot;          - Game Configuration\n\nExtras:\n\nThe Official Mass Effect Manual, and Cover can be found in the &quot;Extras&quot; directory (defualt &quot;x:MassEffect - PortableMassEffectExtras&quot;)\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                  In The Pipeline\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nT-BOX - ZKZ of the Federation Team\n\nGames - Pending\nEMUs  - Complete\nNFO   - Pending\nTest  - Complete\n\nThis release is imminent. This project seeks to combine a Lite (less than 700m)\nVista build, bootscreen, frontend, registry tweaks, several related \napplications, twenty-plus emulators and tens of thousands of various game \nimages and ROMS in an orderly package. This package would then allow a user \nto easily create a SF personal computer (or any other light PC) that would \nact as any console from the first to sixth generation. This has been a huge\nundertaking but if it is successful this project will provide the PC scene with \nthe first real replacement for consoles. Please understand that projects like this one can have unsuspected kinks. Please be patient.\n\nHalf Life Decay Co-op - The Decay Team\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nWe are currently waiting for the Decay Team to release their Beta port (long \noverdue). Once they do, the game will be cracked (if necessary) and released A.S.A.P.\n\nQuake 4 Ultimate Co-op - Opencoop\n\nGame  - Pending\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nAs many of you know opencoop recently released a tech demo of their next project Quake 4 Co-op which allows you to traverse most of the levels, with large amounts of lag, glitches, and crashes. Once they have a clean version working, this Crack-Mod will be released. Because we are waiting for them to finish their work there is no release date.\n\nQuake 2 Co-op - Co-op or Die\n\nGame  - Complete\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nOver the past month Federation members have laboriously struggled to make past  \nreleases updated, thin, and portable. This release is in the works and is  \nexpected to be the last Federation Re-Release. No release date is set.\n\nF.E.A.R. Co-op - Coop Warfare\n\nGame  - Complete\nCrack - Pending\nNFO   - Pending\nMod   - Pending\nTest  - Pending\n\nThis release is being delayed by a lack of interest.
