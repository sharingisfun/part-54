Making HOT FUZZ a leaner, tighter, funnier film. This new version contains many tweaks to the audio and video to clean up many of the cuts and colour correction necessary for seamless integration of some deleted material.\n\nTagline: A Truly Arse-Kicking Cop Movie.\n\nOriginal film name: Hot Fuzz\nNew film name: HOT FUZZ: The Actually Rather Funny Edition\nFilm studio name: Universal Pictures/StudioCanal/Big Talk/Working Title\nEdit crew name: Ghostcut Pictures\nOriginal runtime: 2h 0m\nNew runtime: 1h 43m\nAmount of time cut/added: ~16m 4s cut, 1m 15s added\nCuts removed/added/extended\n\n    * Heavily cut titles.\n    * Janine (played by Cate Blanchett) is cut.\n    * Speeded-up some montages.\n    * Angel does not go to SomerfieldsÃƒÂ¢?? and accuse Simon Skinner of the\n      murders. An extra line from the deleted scenes was added to make\n      it appear that Frank Butterman wonÃƒÂ¢??t let Angel accuse Skinner of\n      anything, let alone act on it. Angel just goes back to the hotel.\n    * Extended fence jump scene.\n    * Also cut some unfunny jokes &amp; unnecessary lines.\n    * Some scenes were trimmed.\n    * Credits heavily edited, ÃƒÂ¢??Solid Gold Easy ActionÃƒÂ¢?? song removed.\n\nA detailed list of changes is available on http://fanedit.org/wpTF/?p=423\n\n-----\n\nAbout this file:\n* Container: MPEG-4\n* Video: H.264\n* Audio: AAC Stereo\n\nA full DVD is only available for the older version at this time. Please check back on fanedit.org to find out when the new DVD will be available.\n\n-----\n\nWhy would someone want to download this version of Hot Fuzz? Because it&amp;#039;s not some cheap cut and paste job. A person with an actual life edited this, in their very limited spare time, purely for fun. This particular edit took me nearly 2 months to complete the first version. If you don&amp;#039;t get the concept, then don&amp;#039;t bother with this at all.\n\nIf you hit and run on this torrent and any other of mine (that is, download the whole thing and don&amp;#039;t bother to seed) you thoroughly deserve to have your ISP poison your torrents.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4ef85e60b7ef4b939b4092d515506e571800fdb","amp;dn":"Hot+Fuzz+-+The+Actually+Rather+Funny+Edition+%5BFan+Edited+by+Ghos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4ef85e60b7ef4b939b4092d515506e571800fdb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,239,133,230,11,126,244,185,57,180,9,45,81,85,6,229,113,128,15,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
