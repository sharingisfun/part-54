This program may be run on Windows 95/98/ Millenium/2000/2003/XP without any limitations. An .EXE file is much harder to casually reverse-engineer, so this could be a way to conceal a particular batch file&amp;#039;s operations from an end user. Content of your batch file will be encrypted and protected from changes. Quick Batch File Compiler also lets you set various resources in the .EXE file, such as its description, the company name, version information and even the application icon. In additional, you may include any files to compiled exe file and use it during execution.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0028206a72062c80e35d6a3ceb5c9a3a959e6c9","amp;dn":"Abyss+Media+Quick+Batch+File+Compiler+3.1.5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0028206a72062c80e35d6a3ceb5c9a3a959e6c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,2,130,6,167,32,98,200,14,53,214,163,206,181,201,163,169,89,230,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
