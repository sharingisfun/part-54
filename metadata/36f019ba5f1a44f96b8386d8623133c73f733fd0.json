I found it useful when tweaking  shortcuts that wouldn&amp;#039;t work right, and also to get copies of what arguments are being passed by a frontend to a backend.\n\n   Source code is included if you want to build it yourself. I wrote it my self in Visual Basic 2005, and it&amp;#039;s a VERY simple program.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:36f019ba5f1a44f96b8386d8623133c73f733fd0","amp;dn":"Show+Command+Line+Arguments+%28find+out+what+args+are+being+sent%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"36f019ba5f1a44f96b8386d8623133c73f733fd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,240,25,186,95,26,68,249,107,131,134,216,98,49,51,199,63,115,63,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
