With O&amp;O DiskImage, you have a high performance tool at your disposal for making professional images of entire computers or drives. After imaging, your old data is quickly available when problems with your computer arise. Simply recall the image and your computer is back as it was before! \n\nO&amp;O DiskImage 2 can perform either an incremental imaging or just as easily image an entire system. The imaged data can then be encrypted and also compressed to various different levels. The splitting of images onto different storage volumes can either be individually set or O&amp;O DiskImage will automate the splitting.\n\nShould only particular files or directories from an image be required, it is not necessary to restore the whole image. Images can be mounted as drives with O&amp;O DiskImage enabling direct access to individual files or directories.\n\nHighlights:\n? Full and Incremental Backups of Any Windows Storage Volume \n? Windows-based Start CD Included \n? Encryption Up to 256-bit \n? User-defined Compression and Splitting of Images \n? Storage Volume Copying \n? Imaging of Hard Disks, CDs, DVDs and Network Drives\n? Integrated Burning Software for CDs and DVDs \n? Support of Dynamic Storage Volumes \n? Full Support on 64-bit Systems \n? Full Microsoft Windows Vista Compatibility \n\nProfessional Backup of Your Data!\nPrevent data loss quickly and easily! With O&amp;O DiskImage, you have a high performance tool at your disposal for making professional images of entire computers or drives. After imaging, your old data is quickly available when problems with your computer arise. Simply recall the image and your computer is back as it was before!\n\nData Imaging Technology from the Defrag Editors Choice\nA string of successful software products in the hard disk arena form the basis of O&amp;O DiskImage. As millions of our happy customers worldwide will testify, O&amp;O has over the years gained considerable expertise in moving files during defragmentation. By using this experience, O&amp;O has now developed a product that enables you to image and restore your entire hard disk. O&amp;O DiskImage supports all important functions and combines this with a user friendly interface for the quick and simple imaging or restoration of data.\n\nA Selection of Different Image Formats\nO&amp;O DiskImage offers two alternatives to choose from when imaging data: a complete image or an incremental image. The complete image provides yet more flexibility with the offer of either a forensic image of the storage medium or an image of the used sectors only. With every image, including incremental images or split images, every piece of information in every image file is saved. This avoids a situation where images may be missed, whilst also maintaining a structural consistency throughout.\n\nCompression and encryption\nO&amp;O DiskImage supports compression and encryption in accordance with AES (128, 196 and 256-bit). Encryption can be configured individually for every image, including incremental images. The readout of information (though not the image files) is also possible where a password is unavailable.\n\nMount Images in Windows Explorer\nComplete and incremental images can be mounted as drives through O&amp;O DiskImage and Windows Explorer and also then unmounted again. This enables direct access to individual files or directories without the need to restore the whole image content.\n\nSplitting Image Files\nImages can be split into either traditional portions (CD, DVD etc.) or also on user-defined scales. An automatic split is also possible, when for example the target drive is full or the maximum file size for the file system has been reached. Compression and encryption for every image can be individually selected too. 64-bit and Multiprocessor Support The creation or restoration of an image is significantly accelerated by the native support of 64-bit and multiprocessor systems. O&amp;O DiskImage supports Windows XP 64-bit.\n\nSystem Restoration without Creation of a Start CD\nFor restoring an entire system there is no need for a rescue CD to be created as a Start CD is provided (the so-called ?bare metal? technology). The CD is based on Windows Server 2003 (PE) and contains all the standard Windows drivers so that, on most systems, a complex integration of drivers is not necessary. The option to install additional hard disk control drivers is however still available. Once the Start CD boots up the PC, O&amp;O DiskImage enables the required image to be selected and then fully restored. \n\nOperating System: Windows Vista, XP, 2000 Pro\n\nhave fun and enjoy The Joker","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c5bd548f43a59476b64b23bfaabbda8bff25593","amp;dn":"O%26O+DiskImage+2+Professional+Edition+2.2+Build+2089+%28The+Joker%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c5bd548f43a59476b64b23bfaabbda8bff25593","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,91,213,72,244,58,89,71,107,100,178,59,250,171,189,168,191,242,85,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
