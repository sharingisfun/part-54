Their dreams of making enough money to settle down happily in one place are shattered when a traffic accident kills his mother, and his father takes so badly to drink that Shane becomes the de facto head of the household. When his grandfather dies, leaving Shane a small ranch in his will, he hopes that his dream might come true at last. But how can a 14-year-old boy turn the run-down place around and keep the banker from seizing it, while attending school and looking after a father who is usually in the liability column?\n\n\nVIDEO INFORMATION:\nResolution: 640 x 480 [4:3]\nVideo Bitrate: 1413 kbps\nCodec: WMV3 = WMP v9 {vc-1Simple}\nRunning Time: 1:42:29 \n\nfor more info go to ---&gt;\n\nIncludes VLC Media Player","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78189246c5ba9c31250082dd2a9f4deae0524592","amp;dn":"Cowboys+Don%5C%27t+Cry%5B1988%5DTV-RiP%5BEng%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78189246c5ba9c31250082dd2a9f4deae0524592","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,24,146,70,197,186,156,49,37,0,130,221,42,159,77,234,224,82,69,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
