Covers included.\n\nMariah Carey [born March 27th 1970 in Huntington, Long Island, New York] is an American hip hop, pop and R&amp;B singer-songwriter, record producer, and actress. She made her recording debut in 1990 under the guidance of Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola, and became the first recording artist to have her first five singles top the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart. Following her marriage to Mottola in 1993, a series of hit records established her position as Columbia&amp;#039;s highest-selling act. According to Billboard magazine, she was the most successful artist of the 1990s in the United States.\n\nE=MC2 is the eleventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Mariah Carey. The album is scheduled to be released on April 14th 2008 in the UK and April 15th U.S.A. The album name means [E] Emancipation [=] of [MC] Mariah Carey [2] to the second power. It is a play on Einstein&amp;#039;s famous mass?energy equivalence formula. The album&amp;#039;s music appeals to a lot of genres such as Pop, R&amp;B and Hip hop, but some of her songs also include Gospel and Reggae beats. She experiments with reggae tones on &amp;#039;Cruise Control&amp;#039; for the first time. The song &amp;#039;I&amp;#039;ll Be Lovin&amp;#039; U Long Time&amp;#039;, samples DeBarge&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;Stay With Me&amp;#039; and recalls the melodic riff of the &amp;#039;Hill Street Blues&amp;#039; theme music. The background riffs and music [although altered] on &amp;#039;For The Record&amp;#039; was used in the promotional commercial for Carey&amp;#039;s debut fragrance, &amp;#039;M&amp;#039;. &amp;#039;Touch My Body&amp;#039; was chosen as the lead single off the album. The single was officially released on February 19th 2008. After entering the Billboard Hot 100 at No.57, the song climbed to the top of the chart becoming Carey&amp;#039;s 18th No.1 single on the Billboard Hot 100, pushing her to second place among artists with the most No.1 singles in the rock era and first place as a solo artist in the same category, surpassing Elvis Presley. I have also included the Japan only bonus tracks in the package, although they are not shown on the cover listing.\n\nTracks:\n01 Migrate [Feat. T-Pain]\n02 Touch My Body\n03 Cruise Control [Feat.
