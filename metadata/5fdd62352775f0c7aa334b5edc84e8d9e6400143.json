That said,             |\n |        these re-issued classics have been brought into the modern         |\n |        era with the introduction of new FMV sequences that beauti-        |\n |        fully illustrate the plot, but the majority of the gameplay        |\n |        takes place in good old fashioned 2D. Fortunately, when the        |\n |        storyline and gameplay are this compelling, the lack of            |\n |        visual flair really doesn't matter.                                |\n |                                                                           |\n |        Final Fantasy IV was the first game in the series to               |\n |        demonstrate the kind of in-depth character development that        |\n |        would make the later titles so successful. The plot centres        |\n |        on the activities of Cecil, a Dark Knight and commander in         |\n |        the Imperial Army, who resigns his post after a crisis of          |\n |        conscience, and is forced to undertake a series of dangerous       |\n |        adventures, and eventually battle the evil Zemus. It was           |\n |        also the first Final Fantasy game to feature the &quot;Active           |\n |        Time Battle System&quot;, which revolutionised turn-based RPGs,         |\n |        and ensured that FF IV was a massive success in both Japan         |\n |        and the US.                                                        |\n |                                                                           |\n |        The ultimate enemy in Final Fantasy V takes the form of a          |\n |        tree, by the name of X-Death, but the real danger is posed         |\n |        by his equally evil (and far more fearsome looking) henchman,      |\n |        Gilgamesh. It's a game that's regarded with great affection        |\n |        by aficionados of the series, thanks to its innovative &quot;job        |\n |        system&quot;. This effectively allows you to assign a job (ranging      |\n |        from Warrior or Magician to Magical Dancer) to a character         |\n |        at any time, which will bestow appropriate skills to the           |\n |        character. Clever use of these jobs in conjunction with            |\n |        skill-boosting items can create a bewildering array of             |\n |        different skills and abilities, lending FFV an impressive          |\n |        level of customisability.                                          |\n |                                                                           |\n |        Both these games are established classics of the RPG genre,        |\n |        and have stood the test of time remarkably well. Although          |\n |        they can't hope to compete with the visuals of contemporary        |\n |        RPGs, their storylines and gameplay more than hold their own       |\n |        in the 21st century. Fans of the Final Fantasy series can't        |\n |        afford to miss these fascinating blasts from the past, and         |\n |        anyone looking for compelling role-playing gameplay will be        |\n |        surprised by how well these two titles have aged.                  |\n |                                                                           |\n_|                            Darkforce Terror!                              |_\n                                                                             /\n __ _                                                                   _ __/\n | ..._ _____________________________________________________________ _/... |","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fdd62352775f0c7aa334b5edc84e8d9e6400143","amp;dn":"%5BPSX%5D+Final.Fantasy.Anthology.Europe.Edition.PAL-DFC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fdd62352775f0c7aa334b5edc84e8d9e6400143","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,221,98,53,39,117,240,199,170,51,75,94,220,132,232,217,230,64,1,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
