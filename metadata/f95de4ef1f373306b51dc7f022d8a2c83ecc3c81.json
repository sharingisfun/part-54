These clip from his radio show are not just funny (though they are VERY funny)-- they&amp;#039;re incisive in ways that comedy usually isn&amp;#039;t. It&amp;#039;s biting parody of radio genres and topics that have never been skewered before.  to &quot;Honey, I Slept With The Kids&quot; for an example. And as an instance of brilliant improv, the lengthy interview with a confused and bitter gender-reassignment recipient may be the most inspired you&amp;#039;ll ever hear. Shearer richly deserves the success he&amp;#039;s found as the voice of Charles Montgomery Burns and Wayland Smithers and Ned Flanders, but after ing to this, you&amp;#039;ll have a much better notion of his comedic instincts. They&amp;#039;re dead on. \n\n      \n1. Cops With Attitude      \n2. Bad Day At Black Rock      \n3. Your Brain On Drugs      \n4. Ice Tennis      \n5. Expose Yourself      \n6.
