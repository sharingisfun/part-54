I have seen other versions of this uploaded on here. The scantlations are from a variety of sources over the years.\n\nUsually each volume is 8-10 chapters long. I figured that at 390 would be a good place to release it in volume form. Each volume is labeled at the beginning as to which chapters it contains (e.g 001-007Volume1 contains chapters one through seven)\n\nI have removed a lot of the \\&amp;#039;bonus\\&amp;#039; materials that wasn\\&amp;#039;t included in the original volumes. Who wants 20 pages of naruto sauske slash in the middle of a volume? I have cleaned up alot of it, but if you run across any, please tell me which volume it is in so that I can fix it with the next release at volume 43.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1079832f62b14188c1903e5818b85aa527facb98","amp;dn":"Naruto+Manga+Volumes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1079832f62b14188c1903e5818b85aa527facb98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,121,131,47,98,177,65,136,193,144,62,88,24,184,90,165,39,250,203,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
