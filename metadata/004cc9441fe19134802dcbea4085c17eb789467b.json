In 1998, the band toured in support of &quot;Miles from Our Home,&quot; a complex record that featured standard rockers like the title cut and mournful beauties like &quot;No Birds Today.&quot; The Junkies also appeared on the phenomenally popular Lillith Fair tour that year.\n\n \n\nAs they had started to do on the 1996 tour, the band included a couple of acoustic numbers in their sets on this tour. A highlight from this show is &quot;Something More Besides You,&quot; which in my opinion is an example of how Michael Timmins can write complex songs that blend hope and fear or despair all at the same time. This song quickly became one of my favorites, along with &quot;Ring on the Sill&quot; and &quot;Witches.&quot;\n\n \n\nOver the years, the band has played a lot of excellent shows in California. In fact, it might be one of the best states to live in if you are a hardcore llama.\n\n \n\nI hope you all enjoy this excellent show!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:004cc9441fe19134802dcbea4085c17eb789467b","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies+1998-08-20+%40+Royce+Hall+-+Los+Angeles%2C+CA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"004cc9441fe19134802dcbea4085c17eb789467b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,76,201,68,31,225,145,52,128,45,203,234,64,133,193,126,183,137,70,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
