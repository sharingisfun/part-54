This is a much rockier show - with Nik, and the second best drummer Hawkwind had during the 80&amp;#039;s. Plus an exciting, lively audience sound, with an especially chainsaw-like Dave Brock guitar.\n\nHawkwind\nQueensway Hall\nDunstable\nU.K.\n1983-02-10\n\nDave Brock: Guitar, keyboards, vocals\nHarvey Bainbridge: Bass Guitar, keyboards, vocals\nHuw Lloyd-Langton: Lead Guitar, vocals\nNik Turner: Saxophone, flute, vocals\nAndy Anderson: Drums\n\nThis was Andy Anderson&amp;#039;s 2nd gig (of only 8) with Hawkwind.\n\nprob.
