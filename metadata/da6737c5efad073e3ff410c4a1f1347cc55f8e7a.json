The topic was wearing thin. &quot;Watchman, Walkman, Thinkman,&quot; &quot;Willpower,&quot; and &quot;Voices in Local Time&quot; do complement well the material found on The Formula (and to a certain extent they could be leftovers). This verse from &quot;Voices in Local Time&quot; sums up the message Hine was trying to get through: &quot;Don&amp;#039;t trust in the slogan/Don&amp;#039;t fall for the line/They&amp;#039;ll be eating your mind.&quot; The other songs mostly fall in the category of mid-&amp;#039;80s dance-pop tunes: simple, light, somehow uninvolved. Hine is a careful producer and a good songwriter, so even when he aims low he hits the target, but fans of his usually intelligent (even intellectual) pop will be disappointed by &quot;Never a Tear&quot; and &quot;Dance Yourself Sane,&quot; which both sound closer to Thomas Dolby circa Aliens Ate My Buick than vintage Hine. He would strike a better balance for Thinkman&amp;#039;s final album, Hard Hat Zone. Chester Kayman and the Fixx&amp;#039;s James West-Oram contribute good guitar parts but they are not enough to raise the level of this weaker effort.\n\n \n\n 01 Watchman, Walkman, Thinkman \n 02 Bad Angel \n 03 Never a Tear \n 04 Life Is a Full Time Occupation \n 05 Walking on My Shadow&amp;#039;s Head \n 06 Dance Yourself Sane \n 07 Willpower \n 08 Slow Game \n 09 Voices in Local Time \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da6737c5efad073e3ff410c4a1f1347cc55f8e7a","amp;dn":"Thinkman+%5BRupert+Hine%5D+-+Life+Is+a+Full+Time+Occupation+%5B1988%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da6737c5efad073e3ff410c4a1f1347cc55f8e7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,103,55,197,239,173,7,62,63,244,16,196,161,241,52,124,197,95,142,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
