But in fact, Chic&amp;#039;s music was that influential -- and its disco/funk/soul innovations would be having an impact long after the &amp;#039;70s ended. From Madonna, Change, and Queen, to Duran Duran, Soul II Soul, and ABC -- new wave, hip-hop, house, European Hi-NRG, Latin freestyle, and acid jazz -- you could write a book about all the artists who have been influenced by Chic. (AMG)\n\n\n\nPERSONNEL\nBernard Edwards (vocals, bass); Alfa Anderson, Luci Martin (vocals); Nile Rodgers (guitar); Tony Thompson (drums).\n\n\n\n1. Chic - Dance, Dance, Dance (The Best Of)\n\nYou think disco was nothing more than assembly line funk and freeze-dried beats? Then you need to step into the crisp grooves and walloping boogie found on this stunning collection of Chic&amp;#039;s &amp;#039;70s recordings. Such hits as &quot;Good Times,&quot; &quot;Dance Dance Dance,&quot; and &quot;Le Freak&quot; used the stylistic innovations of James Brown and Sly Stone as a blueprint for a new era of funk. Bernard Edwards&amp;#039; basslines are so provocative they seem to talk, while Nile Rodgers&amp;#039; skeletal guitar runs hark back to Steve Cropper&amp;#039;s slashing style. Sure, the songs don&amp;#039;t say much. Sure, the dance mixes collected here ramble on after about six minutes. But once you step into these grooves -- grooves that influenced an entire generation of artists from David Byrne to Prince -- you will realize that these were indeed good times. (AMG)\n\n\n01.

Chic - The Best Of Vol.2\n\nFilling out the gaps left by the first volume, The Best of Chic, Vol. 2 proves with its collection of album tracks and singles that Chic was not merely a great disco band, but was a great band, period.
