I love the way it turned out!!  It could have been a little better but hey, im just a quality snob.  I&amp;#039;m sure you guys will enjoy it.  Designing the Motion menu&amp;#039;s was probably the most fun!  There are a few times where the video was rough or i got something in the way of the lense but other than that, it&amp;#039;s stable.  It was perched on one of the tables that the Hollywood Bowl so kindly provides to us to use to dine in the  Box Seats.  Shot right center from FOH it provides a good wide angle view with a vew closeups as listed above, and you will see people walking in front of the camera often because it&amp;#039;s right on the aisle, i cant control that but it&amp;#039;s still incredibly stable and very watchable.  There is also no video between Tom Sawyer and One Little Victory to save space on the tape.  Once we start trading blu-ray&amp;#039;s, it will be released in a blu-ray format seeing as i did HD transfer of this show back to HD tapes to preserve the HD quality but for now, this is as close as you&amp;#039;re going to get.  I hope you enjoy it!  -RJPass","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c12c3e8fcc405aeb023077c6614bde82330908d","amp;dn":"Rush+live+at+the+hollywood+bowl+07-23-2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c12c3e8fcc405aeb023077c6614bde82330908d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,18,195,232,252,196,5,174,176,35,7,124,102,20,189,232,35,48,144,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
