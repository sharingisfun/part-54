He led his own Light Brigade big band during the 1930s,\nthen became a prolific arranger and producer for the better part of the '40s and early\n'50s. Later in the decade he formed the Grand Award label and then in 1959 the\nCommand Records moniker. It was here where Light began to create products\nspecifically for the burgeoning stereo LP market, which at the time was more or less a\nhi-fi audiophile novelty. Under the direction of Terry Snyder, Light and the revolving\ncast known as either the Command All-Stars or simply just the All-Stars, began to\nexperiment with extreme stereophonics, using close microphone techniques and\nhard-left or hard-right panning to re-create a comparatively austere sense of what\ncould be accomplished with two distinct channels of sound. This contrasted the\nconventional monophonic playback medium, which delivered a solitary audio source.\nAs innocuous as that may seem, it was cutting-edge technology for its time. Light's\ninterest extended into the recording process itself as he was one of the early\nproponents of 35 millimeter film rather than magnetic-based audio tape. This would\nsignificantly increase both frequency response, as well as the permanence of\nplayback. In many ways, Provocative Percussion is the fraternal twin of Persuasive\nPercussion (1959). They are both borne of the same motivation and are &amp;quot;modern\ninterpretations of familiar and popular music standards circa 1960. Stylistically,\nhowever, the Provocative collections utilize a much more aggressive approach to the\npresentation, as if it were a novelty rather than actually furthering the dimension to\nthe listening experience. The bongo intro that harshly pans from left to right during\nthe introduction to &amp;quot;You're the Top&amp;quot; is essentially replicated with a wooden guiro\nduring the incipient moments of &amp;quot;Love for Sale.&amp;quot; These are notably austere when\ncompared to the extended instrumental ensemble scores that follow. They evoke the\nlate-'50s Atomic Age retro chic and space-age bachelor pad sensibility borne of John\nLautner's Googie-inspired abstract architecture, which likewise informed a majority of\nthe gatefold LP jackets. In 1995, Provocative Percussion (1995) was released on CD\nwith six additional sides from Provocative Percussion, Vol. 2 (1960) -- including the\ndefinitive reading of &amp;quot;Hernando's Hideaway,&amp;quot; which is immediately recognizable from\nthe opening castanet chatter to the swirling accordion solos. Keen-eyed observers will\nalso note that the artwork used for the compact disc reissue was taken from the\nsecond volume, rather than the first. This is a highly recommended kitsch-classic.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4916cb3088fce3d987e3ff401756fe1b0abb80e","amp;dn":"Enoch+Light+-+Provocative+Percussion+%28Exotica-1959%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4916cb3088fce3d987e3ff401756fe1b0abb80e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,145,108,179,8,143,206,61,152,126,63,244,1,117,111,225,176,171,184,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
