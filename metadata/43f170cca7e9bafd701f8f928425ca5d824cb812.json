Again, the album is the outcome of jam sessions with a group of real musicians, the Disposable Rhythm Section. This time it is jazz (a latin-tinged jazz, needless to say) that Friedman deconstructs, not dub. Horns, vibe and percussions embellish Octrahedal Spherical Caffufle, Demolition Derby, Los Corraleros , Destination Unknown. But the highlights are probably the tracks that leasu stick to the dogma: the ambient dub/funk of Platin Tundra and the surreal world-music of Escape the Night (somewhat reminiscent of Herbie Hancock).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43f170cca7e9bafd701f8f928425ca5d824cb812","amp;dn":"Burnt+Friedman+-+Con+Ritmo+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43f170cca7e9bafd701f8f928425ca5d824cb812","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,241,112,204,167,233,186,253,112,31,143,146,132,37,202,93,130,76,184,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
