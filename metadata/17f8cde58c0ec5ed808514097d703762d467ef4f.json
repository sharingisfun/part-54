He then used a prosthetic metal hand to substitute his lost limb. In another laboratory accident with a new ray, if he received an electric shock he would become invisible for a limited period of time with the exception of his artificial hand.\n\nCrandell used his new found gift initially to steal and become a psychotic criminal. So much so that in early strips he was clearly a villain, or anti-hero, but later decided to use it to crime fighting. (it was explained that the laboratory accident that made it possible for him to become invisible had temporary made him insane). He joined a British sucks secret service and espionage agency known as the Shadow Squad. Armed with his steel claw, which by now was equipped with a variety of weapons and tools in each finger as well as his power of invisibility, Louis Crandell battled various criminal geniuses, aliens and the organisation known as F.E.A.R. (the Federation for Extortion, Assassination and Rebellion).\n\nLouis Crandell briefly donned a superhero outfit for a time during his adventures, this was not to last long though and Crandell returned to his secret agent roots. By now his Claw was remote controlled and stacked full of gadgets. After retiring from the Shadow Squad, Louis Crandell became a detective and then a bounty hunter before distrust of his past eventually led him to go to South America, where he would continue to fight crime.\n\n[/size]\n[/b]\n[img]http://i272.photobucket.com/albums/jj200/citaltras/enjoy.jpg[/img]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17f8cde58c0ec5ed808514097d703762d467ef4f","amp;dn":"ZARPA+DE+ACERO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17f8cde58c0ec5ed808514097d703762d467ef4f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,248,205,229,140,14,197,237,128,133,20,9,125,112,55,98,212,103,239,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
