As with other MMORPGs, people control a character avatar within a persistent game world, exploring the landscape, fighting monsters, performing quests, building skills, and interacting with NPCs as well as other players. The game rewards success with money, items, experience and reputation, which in turn allow players to improve their skill and power. Players can level up their characters from level one to level 60, level 70 if they have The Burning Crusade expansion, or level 80 if they have the yet to be released Wrath of the Lich King expansion.[8] In addition, players may opt to take part in battles against other players of an enemy faction, in PvP battlegrounds or in normal world zones subject to the rules in place on the particular server. Duels can also be fought between members of the same or opposing factions, although these do not provide tangible rewards. Many players also choose to join guilds in order to conduct raids against enemy territories and instances.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFiles in the folders\n\n&gt;&gt; README.txt\n&gt;&gt; Register on Exceptional-WoW.html\n&gt;&gt; Downloaders &gt;&gt; WoW Classic Client Downloader.exe\n&gt;&gt; Downloaders &gt;&gt; WoW TBC Client Downloader.exe\n&gt;&gt; Realmlist &gt;&gt; realmlist.wtf\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5679fd4bc5aa4eaaec692e4f8946d6847f2efb01","amp;dn":"World+of+Warcraft+%2B+Private+Server+24%2F7","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5679fd4bc5aa4eaaec692e4f8946d6847f2efb01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,121,253,75,197,170,78,170,236,105,46,79,137,70,214,132,127,46,251,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
