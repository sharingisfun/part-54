While a version of the group remains active to this day, off stage the Beach Boys were touched by scandal, tragedy, and internal discord, and this documentary (first aired on the VH1 cable television network) examines the peaks and valleys of the group\\&amp;#039;s personal and professional fortunes. The Beach Boys: Endless Harmony features footage of the group performing most of their biggest hits, as well as unreleased versions of \\&quot;California Girls,\\&quot; \\&quot;Sloop John B.\\&quot;, \\&quot;God Only Knows\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Heroes and Villains\\&quot;; the DVD edition features additional performances not included in the broadcast or VHS editions, as well as special 5.1 Surround Sound remixes of seven songs, including \\&quot;California Girls\\&quot;, \\&quot;God Only Knows,\\&quot; \\&quot;Surf\\&amp;#039;s Up,\\&quot; and \\&quot;Sail On Sailor.\\&quot;\n\n\nDirected by \nAlan Boyd    \n  \n\nCast (in credits order) \n Brian Wilson ...
