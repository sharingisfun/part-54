Backed by a small combo featuring guitarist Tommy Tedesco and the outstanding bop pianist Jimmy Rowles, Fitzgerald gracefully--almost effortlessly--swings her way through a well-chosen selection of standards. &quot;Autumn in New York&quot; and &quot;Deep Purple&quot; have both been recorded endlessly, but rarely have they sounded so sweet.\n\nElla&amp;#039;s performance on this album won her the 1984 Grammy Award for Best Jazz Vocal Performance, Female, one of three Grammys she won for her work with Nelson Riddle.\n\nPersonnel: Ella Fitzgerald, Al Aarons, Bob Cooper, Bill Green, Art Hillery, Jim Hughart, Ronald Langiner, Hubert Laws, Shelly Manne, Joe Pass, Jimmy Rowles, Marshall Royal, Wilbur Schwartz, Tommy Tedesco, Bill Watrous and Nelson Riddle as Conductor.\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.Don&amp;#039;t Be That Way\n2.God Bless The Child\n3.I Wonder Where Our Love Has Gone\n4.You&amp;#039;re Driving Me Crazy\n5.Any Old Time\n6.Good-Bye\n7.Autumn In New York\n8.Best Is Yet To Come, The\n9.Deep Purple\n10.Somewhere In The Night","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:670c6658b34cacb581c0f060d711ac26be24f0a3","amp;dn":"Ella+Fitzgerald+-+The+Best+Is+Yet+to+Come+%281982%29+RESEED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"670c6658b34cacb581c0f060d711ac26be24f0a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,12,102,88,179,76,172,181,129,192,240,96,215,17,172,38,190,36,240,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
