Somewhere between the two is Zyklon-B, an obvious side-project of simple, almost only  sketched in songs in the black metal and grindcore tradition with a strong melodic noise  arrangement and production tendency. \n\nIt is to little effect, however, for these songs are put together from obvious fragments of  scales and repeated basic melodic arrangements, causing the experienced listener to perceive  it as a cross between show tunes and death-march music sped up on tape. \n\nIndeed one of the distinctive characteristics of this music are the blasting pumpbeats  racing by under the kicking double-bass and wailing snare; above it a cymbal whips and a  slashing tempo upholds the high-hat, hit. With all guitar buried in the wash it neatly  integrates with the drums to produce a clipping pattern interrupting a sonorous but vapid  melody. \n\nFar from the worst of this genre this music nevertheless takes it nowhere and seems to be  less serious than raging, unrepentant energy; the culmination of this style of work is in  the final song Warfare, which adds a more sublime melodic sense and ripping guitar solos  under a keyboard wash to create a scary, brutal song. Like other songs, it is built from  abrupt changes and decorated with samples, but here the combination works in an altogether  more powerful aspect than the previous two songs. \n\nThis is an EP of three songs, at eleven minutes of music, and as such may seal its fate as  the first of the truly outrageous side projects in black metal. Boasting Ihsahn on keyboards and Samoth on guitars from the band Emperor, this plays into the simple but effective  formula of the side project: sketches of inspiration laid out for amusement.\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
