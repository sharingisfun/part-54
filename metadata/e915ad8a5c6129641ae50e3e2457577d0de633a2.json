July 17, 1959) was an American jazz singer and songwriter.\n\nNicknamed Lady Day by her sometime collaborator Lester Young, Holiday was a seminal influence on jazz, and pop singing. Her vocal style ? strongly inspired by instrumentalists ? pioneered a new way of manipulating wording and tempo, and also popularized a more personal and intimate approach to singing. Critic John Bush wrote that she &quot;changed the art of American pop vocals forever.&quot; She co-wrote only a few songs, but several of them have become jazz standards, notably &quot;God Bless the Child,&quot; &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Explain,&quot; and &quot;Lady Sings the Blues.&quot;\nContents\n\n\n\n\n.ooOO ROSA MANNEN 2008 OOoo.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e915ad8a5c6129641ae50e3e2457577d0de633a2","amp;dn":"Billie+Holiday+-+The+Blues+Are+Brewin%5C%27+%28Live+Hal+Roach+Studio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e915ad8a5c6129641ae50e3e2457577d0de633a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,21,173,138,92,97,41,100,26,229,14,62,36,87,87,125,13,230,51,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
