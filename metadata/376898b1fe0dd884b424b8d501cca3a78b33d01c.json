Faced with day to day survival in a \n    hostile and alien landscape, our heroes are not concerned with the \n    course of the war. Their only goals are escaping from the NVA and the \n    Viet Cong, and finding enough weapons, food and medical supplies to \n    keep going. The game focuses on their experiences as they inch their \n    way back to the relative safety of the Imperial city of Hue. \n\n    You'll have to depend on four men to make it through this hostile \n    terrain: \n    Staff Sergeant Frank Wier, your leader and rifleman, Corporal Bruce \n    Lesh, your sniper and grenadier, Corporal Will Shafer, your machine \n    gunner, and Private Harold Kahler, your field medic. \n\n    You'll need to keep all four alive in order to make it to Hue, and\n    need to fully utilize every one if you plan on surviving at all.\n    \n                                                                          \n    Ripped:                                                                   \n    ~~~~~~~                                                                   \n    This is the Music addon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:376898b1fe0dd884b424b8d501cca3a78b33d01c","amp;dn":"Conflict.Vietnam.Music.Addon-MYTH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"376898b1fe0dd884b424b8d501cca3a78b33d01c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,104,152,177,254,13,216,132,180,36,184,213,1,204,163,167,139,51,208,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
