Laibow, MD, about Codex Alimentarius. Alex also welcomes Dr. Ron Paul. Special guest today is David Icke, who recently announced he will run in Britain's parliamentary by-election. \n\nSourced from the 32 Kbps live stream using Total Recorder 7 Pro, or from the 42 Kbps podcast.  Re-encoded to 32 Kbps @ 22.05 KHz.  Editing done using Nero WaveEditor 4 by hand. Four hours duration before commercial edit takes it down to about 3 hours of playing time.  \n\nNote, there was a break in the show during the first hour (no guest at the time) for about 4 minutes.  I edited out the music/dead air.
