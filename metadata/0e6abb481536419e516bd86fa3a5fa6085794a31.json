The song was released as a single from her multi-platinum album Ã‚Â¿DÃƒÂ³nde EstÃƒÂ¡n los Ladrones? (1998) and later from her acoustic performance of the song on the MTV show Unplugged (2000). On the song, the singer express how she believes in nothing (and nobody) except true love. It was Shakira most successful single in the Billboard Hot 100, until the release of her first-ever English album. The song references popular socially-accepted or non-accepted norms such as herself, luck, Karl Marx, Jean Paul Satre, Mars and Venus, and Brian Weiss.\n\nThe video begins in a room, where Shakira jumps out of a window into a grassland where eccentric people are present. She scratches the ceiling of a room, goes through dark rooms, riots, swims through a washing room. The video is also present in her hit, Ciega, Sordomuda, which is therefore sparking rumors some scenes were shot back-to-back with Ciega, Sordomuda.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e6abb481536419e516bd86fa3a5fa6085794a31","amp;dn":"Shakira+-+No+Creo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e6abb481536419e516bd86fa3a5fa6085794a31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,106,187,72,21,54,65,158,81,107,216,111,163,165,250,96,133,121,74,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
