Here is a nice selection of many different adverts from the  classic breakfast cereals.   These commercials were done by Jay Ward Studios, the same people that brought you Rocky and Bullwinkle.\n\nWarning:  These Adverts may cause flashbacks to the 1960&amp;#039;s and 70&amp;#039;s!\n\n\nHere&amp;#039;s the story.  I am converting all of my old &quot;Fan Tapes&quot; over from VHS to DVD and also ripping them to AVI files.\nHopefully I can post up some videos that are hard to find and help add to other peoples collections. There is a lot of \nof animation as well as some live action.  Sorry if the quality  is lacking on some of these old shows. Please try to \nremember that they are coming off of home recorded video tapes. Some of them are copies of copies and the tapes\nhave been in storage for a while. I have my system set for the best quality rip I can get, but I can only do so much.\nWould love to hear feedback!  Check out my other Torrents at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SlumLord301/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/SlumLord301/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nI am looking to hear from other American Animation collectors.  Especially collectors of Hanna-Barbera ,\nFreleng/DePatie,  Jay Ward Studios, and others.  I have a long want list for animation in my collection.  Everything \nI have on tape is eventually going to be posted as Torrents.  I will share everything I have with whomever wants it.\nIf you have files or knowledge to share please e-mail me at:\n\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a2d1ced7cfcecdd0c6919293e2dbc3cacdcd8cc1cdcf&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nSHARING IS CARING!  ..........oh yeah, PIRATE BAY IS THE BEST!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f0e81b91d5299ada5e5cbb6f84cd41bf221da8ad","amp;dn":"Classic+Quisp+and+Quake+Breakfast+Cereal+Commercials","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f0e81b91d5299ada5e5cbb6f84cd41bf221da8ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,232,27,145,213,41,154,218,94,92,187,111,132,205,65,191,34,29,168,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
