They have one obvious claim to distinction: the presence among their line-up of a &quot;hang&quot;, a new-fangled instrument that sounds like an ultra-refined cousin of the steel pan. It gives the band a soft-edged, exotic sound that make it ripe for the crossover market.\n\nFortunately it&amp;#039;s more than that. Jack Wyllie plays a beautifully lyrical high sax, Mike Fitzpatrick is a coolly inventive bass player. The music&amp;#039;s melodic hooks are smoothly appealing, but its rhythmic subtleties and harmonic twists save it from blandness.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60510b922a2d43bd49dc117a215969c6bd046bb7","amp;dn":"2007+-+Portico+Quartet+-+Knee+Deep+in+the+North+Sea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60510b922a2d43bd49dc117a215969c6bd046bb7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,81,11,146,42,45,67,189,73,220,17,122,33,89,105,198,189,4,107,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
