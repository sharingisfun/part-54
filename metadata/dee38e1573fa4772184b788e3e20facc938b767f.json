However, his supporting cast (heard from in different combinations) includes such major players as altoists Jackie McLean, Antonio Hart and Paquito D&amp;#039;Rivera and tenors Benny Golson, Clifford Jordan and David Sanchez, in addition to a strong trio led by pianist DanÃƒÂ­lo Perez. The sidemen are in generally fine form and Bobby McFerrin literally came out of the audience to scat on &quot;Oo Pa Pa Da.&quot; The good spirits and obvious love that these musicians had for Gillespie make up for his technical lapses. ~ All Music Guide\n\nPersonnel:Paquito d&amp;#039;Rivera (Clarinet), Paquito d&amp;#039;Rivera (Sax (Alto)), Dizzy Gillespie (Trumpet),  Antonio Hart (Sax (Alto)), Bobby McFerrin (Vocals), DanÃƒÂ­lo Perez (Piano), Kenny Washington (Drums), Lewis Nash (Drums), Charles Fishman (Producer), Benny Golson (Sax (Tenor)), Clifford Jordan (Sax (Tenor).\n\nTrack Lisitng:\n1.Billie&amp;#039;s Bounce (Charlie Parker)(15:21)\n2.Bebop (Dizzy Gillespie)(11:44)\n3.Ornithology (Benny Harris, Charlie Parker)(10:40)\n4.Anthropology (Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker)(10:56)\n5.Oop-Pop-A-Da (Dizzy Gillespie, Babs Gonzales)(11:21)\n6.The Diamond Jubilee Blues (Dizzy Gillespie)(1:53)\n7.The Theme (Dizzy Gillespie)(1:25)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dee38e1573fa4772184b788e3e20facc938b767f","amp;dn":"Dizzy+Gillespie+-+To+Bird+With+Love%3A+Live+at+the+Blue+Note+%281992","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dee38e1573fa4772184b788e3e20facc938b767f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,227,142,21,115,250,71,114,24,75,120,142,62,32,250,204,147,139,118,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
