Though mainly a pianist, Coles played a number of instruments and had been seen previously performing the clarinet solos on the Bronski Beat hit &quot;It Ain&amp;#039;t Necessarily So.&quot; They were joined by bass player Dave Renwick who had also played with Bronski Beat. Somerville was well-known for his falsetto singing style, and that he was openly gay during a period of increasing socio-political debate and conflict in the UK regarding homosexuality.\n\n\n\n\n\n.ooOO ROSA MANNEN 2008 OOoo.\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/RosaMannen&lt;/a&gt;\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:be127adc2234880d06cd550aa5bb578ad6223a1d","amp;dn":"The+Communards+-+Dancing+Queen+%28Live+Friday+Night+1988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"be127adc2234880d06cd550aa5bb578ad6223a1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,18,122,220,34,52,136,13,6,205,85,10,165,187,87,138,214,34,58,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
