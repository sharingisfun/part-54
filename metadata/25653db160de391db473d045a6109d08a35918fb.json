None of it was recovered. Nobody was ever arrested. The robbery \nmade headlines for a few days and then disappeared - the result of a &amp;#039;D&amp;#039; Notice, \ngagging the press. This film reveals what was hidden for the first time. The \nstory involves murder, corruption and a sex scandal with links to the Royal \nFamily - a story in which the thieves were the most innocent people involved.\n\nRelease Info\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\nTheater Date:......... 28 February 2008 (UK) \nRelease Date:......... 03 March 2008\nIMDB Rating:.......... 8.2/10 (471 votes)                  \nURL:.................. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200465/\nGenre:................
