Grigg\n\nFor over a decade, prior to his retirement, Dr. Monteith led a delegation of physicians from Santa Cruz County to the House of Delegates of the California Medical Association. For 10 years he led the battle \nwithin organized medicine in California to address the AIDS epidemic as a medical issue rather than a civil rights issue. As a result of his experiences trying to implement an effective medical approach to the HIV epidemic, he wrote the book, &quot;AIDS:The Unnecessary Epidemic&quot;, the widely circulated pamphlet, &quot;To Deceive a Nation&quot;, and more recently, &quot;A Nation Deceived and Betrayed.&quot; Supported by physicians across our nation, his public health approach to the HIV epidemic was eventually accepted by the \nCalifornia Medical Association. Unfortunately, powerful forces continue to oppose the dictates of doctors. Dr Monteith currently spends five hours daily on talk radio, writes extensively, and lectures on \ngeopolitics. He has spent 30 years researching the causes for America&amp;#039;s spiritual and moral decline.\n\nDr Stans guest is William N.
