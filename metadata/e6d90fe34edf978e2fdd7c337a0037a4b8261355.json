The film speaks to former gangsters, shocked by the new levels of casual violence, including one who&amp;#039;s trying to turn youngsters away from guns.\n\nIt follows the latest police efforts to stem the gun culture, going out on patrol with Merseyside Police&amp;#039;s elite anti-gun and gangs unit. And, after weeks on the ground, comes face to face with the young gunmen themselves.\n\nAspect Ratio: 16:9 Widescreen 720x406\n\nVideo: Xvid 1000kbps 25fps\n\nAudio: MP3 128kbps CBR Stereo\n\n[Frank_UK]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6d90fe34edf978e2fdd7c337a0037a4b8261355","amp;dn":"Panorama+%5BBBC+One%5D+%5BYoung+Gunmen%5D+%5BXvid%5D+%5BFrank_UK%5D.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6d90fe34edf978e2fdd7c337a0037a4b8261355","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,217,15,227,78,223,151,142,47,221,124,51,122,0,55,164,184,38,19,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
