I found out the name of the remaining album, which I have yet to download. It&amp;#039;s called A Heavy Dose of Lyte Psych. I&amp;#039;ll begin the search for that one tomorrow, so hopefully I can complete the series.\n\nWhat sets this apart from the many other similar &amp;#039;60s garage-psych releases is the extremeness of the music. Tracks collected here feature grungier guitars, slower or varied tempos and darker and more ominous atmosphere than earlier punk singles...and more fuzz and heavier feedback (even the occasional oscillator). These tracks were typically cut later than many of the other garage-band compilation series, and influences are second generation bands like Steppenwolf, Blue Cheer, Love, and the Stooges. While poppier sounds are eschewed on these sides, according to the liner notes these heavier slabs are the flip sides of lighter material. If the ballads on garage comps are the ones you skip over, by all means pick up a copy of this collection...you won&amp;#039;t be disappointed. An extra bonus are six caveman-stomping cuts by the Boneheaded 31 Flavors, originally from two low-budget psych-sploitation albums on the Crown label.\n\nTrack List:\n1.
