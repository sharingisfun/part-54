Their &quot;spiritual quest&quot;, however, veers rapidly off-course (due to events involving over-the-counter pain killers, Indian cough syrup, and pepper spray), and they eventually find themselves stranded alone in the middle of the desert with eleven suitcases, a printer, and a laminating machine. At this moment, a new, unplanned journey suddenly begins.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac7e9e2c3bc7e983828b284435bc9af832e31ba6","amp;dn":"The.Darjeeling.Limited.DVDRip.XviD-DMT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac7e9e2c3bc7e983828b284435bc9af832e31ba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,126,158,44,59,199,233,131,130,139,40,68,53,188,154,248,50,227,27,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
