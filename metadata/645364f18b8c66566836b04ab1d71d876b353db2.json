The v-c has every switch and knob of the real machine, but will not need a high-spec PC to run it. This version really stands out with its self-shadowing (V-C self shadowing too, for SP2/Acceleration users), subtle bump mapping and bloom fx (fantastic on the bare-metal schemes !). Custom animations for the famous F-105 tail &amp;#039;petals&amp;#039; provide the various positions of these large appendages and a working drag chute provides the decelleration on touchdown. The 2D panel suite is a masterpiece in itself - large, authentic instruments and custom pop-up panels make flying the F-105D a joy in both sims. The kneeboard reference includes several annotated panel images (see links below). A custom soundset is inlcuded. To top it all, we were honoured to have a real F-105D &amp;#039;Nam veteran pilot beta test the flight dynamics and co-develop the models - now that&amp;#039;s as real as it gets !!
