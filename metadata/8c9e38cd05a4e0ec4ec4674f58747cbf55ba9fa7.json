That all depends on who you ask.  If you were to ask Robert Downey Jr. how much cocaine HE could do in a single night...well...I think you might be suprised by the answer.  Watch this movie, and watch his REAL life leak out onto the screen.  How much of that was acting?\n\nSo, we have Drugstore cowboy for the 70's, Trainspotting for the 90's, Spun for the 00's, it's time to fill in the 80's now.  I think every era should be complete, and have it's own drug movie.\n\nXviD 1.1.0 Beta 2 and OPTIONAL external subtitles are in English, French, Spanish (VOBsub Format) \n\n----\n\nMini Plot:\n\nClay, an eighteen-year-old freshman, comes back from his first term at a college in New Hampshire to spend his Christmas vacation with his broken-up wealthy family in Los Angeles. His former girlfriend, Blair, is now involved with his ex-best-friend, Julian. She warns Clay that Julian needs help: he is using a lot of cocaine and has huge debts. What follows is a look at the youth culture of wealthy post adolescents in Beverly Hills with a strong anti-drug message. Apart from the setting and the names, the film has very little to do with Bret Easton Ellis's book by the same title on which it was based.\n\n----\n\nEncoded by: sickboy88\nCodec: XviD 1.1.0 Beta 2\nBitrate: 858 kb/s AVG\nAspect: 640x352 = 1.82:1\nAudio: English, 128 VBR Stereo @ 48K Hz\nSubtitles: External (Optional): English, French, Spanish - VOBsub Format\nRuntime: 01:38:20\nFPS: 23.976\n\n----\n\nIf you are going to watch this, you'll want to install the NEW XviD codec:\n\nNow at Beta 2!\n\nhttp://www.koepi.org/XviD-1.1.0-Beta2-04042005.exe\n\nFor top quality, make sure you use the XviD decoder configerator, and turn\non (Y) and (UV) deblocking, and the new feature of\nXviD 1.1.0 (Y) and (UV) DERINGING.\n\nIf you have a slow computer, please turn off pre-processing.
