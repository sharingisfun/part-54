Perhaps the most noteworthy item, in the context of the larger Discworld mythology, is that The Wee Free Men is the first and so far only novel in which Death does not appear.\n\nMy recording from BBC7 at 160kbps CBR joint-stereo LAME mp3.\n\nFreeview -&gt; DVD Recorder -&gt; MP3.\n\nHave fun &amp; please seed,\n\nSeymourDAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fa9800dea6987f6010c03f407f32d629179d473","amp;dn":"The+Wee+Free+Men+by+Terry+Pratchett+-+Discworld+Reading+-+Seymou","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fa9800dea6987f6010c03f407f32d629179d473","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,169,128,13,234,105,135,246,1,12,3,244,7,243,45,98,145,121,212,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
