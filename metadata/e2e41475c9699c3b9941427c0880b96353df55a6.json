This is supposed to be one of the late Elvis&amp;#039; better shows and probably one of the finest after 1975. According to the label the source for this release has been a better tape so the sound quality could have been improved. While IMO this is not the case it&amp;#039;s still a good release and a chance for those who missed the original Burning In Birmingham a few years ago.\n\nEncoded using the lossless format flac so you can burn a CD-R from this.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.
