This is their best one in my opinion. It is also the longest as well. The performance and power is just fucking amazing, this is a band at the top of their game and they are definetly one of the best American bands going. They have consistently put out great albums and never fail in delivering the goods. This is a must for anyone into powerful fast melodic punk rock. Get this and you won't be disappointed. Enjoy!\n\nA little bit of trivia, this is the line-up that emerged after Chris Shiflett left them to join the Foo Fighters. The bass player is the original Face To Face bass player. \n\nNo Use For A Name-Bizarre Festival Germany 20 August 2000 SVCD 52 Minutes\n\nCome and join www.punktorrents.com for more of this kind of thing.\n\nEnjoy bandit999\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f99cb665e0396738687e89e7d63d2f4bc49f0c8f","amp;dn":"No+Use+For+A+Name-Bizarre+Festival+Germany+20+August+2000+SVCD.b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f99cb665e0396738687e89e7d63d2f4bc49f0c8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,156,182,101,224,57,103,56,104,126,137,231,214,61,47,75,196,159,12,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
