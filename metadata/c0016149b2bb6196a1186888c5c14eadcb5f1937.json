Not as bombastic and stylized as Glass or as precious as Reich but every bit as curious and whimsical as father of minimalism Terry Riley.  Essential for fans of minimalist music.  \n\n&quot;Cayuga Nights&quot; is inspired by the long winters where Borden lives near Lake Cayuga, NY.  Impressionistic ambient music at it&amp;#039;s best.\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c0016149b2bb6196a1186888c5c14eadcb5f1937","amp;dn":"David+Borden++Complete+Continuing+Story+Of+Counterpoint+%26+Cayuga","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c0016149b2bb6196a1186888c5c14eadcb5f1937","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,1,97,73,178,187,97,150,161,24,104,136,197,193,78,173,203,95,25,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
