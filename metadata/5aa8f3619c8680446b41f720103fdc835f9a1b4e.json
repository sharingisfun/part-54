It was his most popular post-Creedence album, containing the hit singles &quot;The Old Man Down the Road&quot;, &quot;Rock and Roll Girls&quot; and the title track &quot;Centerfield&quot;. Fogerty played all the instruments on this album himself, thanks to overdubbing. The image on the cover shows an old-fashioned, &quot;beat-up glove&quot;, as referenced in the title song, and text similar to a logo of a baseball team, setting the mood for the track.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5aa8f3619c8680446b41f720103fdc835f9a1b4e","amp;dn":"John+Fogerty+-+Centerfield","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5aa8f3619c8680446b41f720103fdc835f9a1b4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,168,243,97,156,134,128,68,107,65,247,32,16,63,220,131,95,154,27,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
