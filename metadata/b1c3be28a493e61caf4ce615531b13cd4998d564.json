Capable of withstanding anything\n\t\tthe Angels can dish out, the Evangelion's one drawback lies in the\n\t\tlimited number of people ablel to pilot them. Only a handful of\n                teenagers, all born fourteen years ago, nine months after the\n                Angels first appeared, are able to interface with the Evangelion.\n                One such tenager is Shinji Ikari, whose father heads the NERV \n                team that developed and maintains the Evangelion.\n\t\tThrust into a maelstormi of battle and events that he does not\n                understand, Shinji is forced to plumb the idepths of his own \n                inner resources for the courage and strength to not lonly fight,\n                but to survive, or risk losing everything. The extraordinarily\n                popular television series that took Japan by storm, NEON GENESIS\n                EVANGELION is the latest project of Gainax, creators of \n\t\tGunbuster, and Nadia, Secret of Blue Water.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1c3be28a493e61caf4ce615531b13cd4998d564","amp;dn":"%5BAnime%5DNeon+Genesis+Evangelion+1+NORDIC+DVDR+PAL-ICE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1c3be28a493e61caf4ce615531b13cd4998d564","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,195,190,40,164,147,230,28,175,76,230,21,83,27,19,205,73,152,213,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
