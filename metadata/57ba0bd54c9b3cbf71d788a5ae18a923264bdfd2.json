This is his third album, after Mr. Marley (1996) and the Grammy award winning &quot;Halfway Tree&quot; (2001).\n\nThe first single &quot;Welcome to Jamrock&quot; stormed the charts on release, with its blaring air horn and Ine Kamoze sample, causing much controversy in his homeland of Jamaica with its hard hitting, critical lyrics about poverty and politics:\n\n&quot;Come on let&amp;#039;s face it, a ghetto education&amp;#039;s basic\nA most a the youths them waste it\nAnd when they waste it, that&amp;#039;s when they take the guns and replace it\nThen them don&amp;#039;t stand a chance at all&quot;\n\nThe album is an expose of the side of Jamaica the tourists don&amp;#039;t see, and music wise is a fusion of reggae, dancehall, R&amp;B and even Hip Hop, starring his brother Stephen, with a guest list that includes Bobby Brown, Nas, Bounty Killer, Buju Banton and others. He even includes a part of a Marcus Garvey speech in the opening track.\n\nSongs to watch are &quot;Move&quot;, which samples his dad&amp;#039;s &quot;Exodus&quot;; &quot;Khaki Suit&quot;, a true dancehall treasure with Bounty Killer; &quot;Pimpa&amp;#039;s Paradise&quot;, a sad tale of drugs and prostitution; &quot;All Night&quot;, and &quot;In 2 Deep&quot;, but there are others worth a listen. An unusual and exciting album for fans of Reggae and Caribbean music.\n\n\n\n\nTrack Listing \n\t\n1. Confrontation \n2. There For You \t\n3. Welcome To Jamrock \t\n4. The Master Has Come Back \t\n5.
