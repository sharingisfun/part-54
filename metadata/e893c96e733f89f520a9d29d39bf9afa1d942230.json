Liza Minelli never did anything as good ever again. \nSet in Germany between the wars. Flaky Showgirl (Liza Minelli) meets new-in-town english tutor (Michael York). \nLots of good music and shownumbers (if you like that kind of stuff). \nAll during a time where nazism is slowly crawling out from under the rocks.\nSwedish subtitles (not optional I'm afraid)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e893c96e733f89f520a9d29d39bf9afa1d942230","amp;dn":"Cabaret+Xvid+SWESub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e893c96e733f89f520a9d29d39bf9afa1d942230","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,147,201,110,115,63,137,245,32,169,210,157,57,191,154,250,29,148,34,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
