It is the theatrical version with the last 20 or so minutes removed and replaced with a black and white copy of the original ending.  The original ending was released on a Disc 2 of the DVD but then quickly recalled by the producers; however, you can still find it on the net.  The sound is imperfect and the transitions between the theatrical and the original are imperfect.  So if you think you can do a better job at it, go for it.  Sorry no subs.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58eb9a4f6b29582e1c968ff2273b27f18c9b18d8","amp;dn":"Little.Shop.of.Horrors.%281986%29.Original.Pre-Theatrical.Ending.Dra","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58eb9a4f6b29582e1c968ff2273b27f18c9b18d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,235,154,79,107,41,88,46,28,150,143,242,39,59,39,241,140,155,24,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
