But don&amp;#039;t let his recent high ammount of releases shadow the fact that the progression within Hypothermia is steadily evolving, his flood of creativity is not to be held back, it is to be supported. This, his latest full-lenght masterpiece is a slow and trance-inducing journey into wide open wounds and crimson red poetry. Black Metal forged in blood and decadence. This is nothing less then music for your funeral to come.\n\nEAC Lame 3.97 v0 VBR with log","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a87f555951ec709a5a5405bddd4f239944afd596","amp;dn":"Hypothermia+%282007%29+-+Rakbladsvalsen+%28V0%29+%2ASwedish+DSBM%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a87f555951ec709a5a5405bddd4f239944afd596","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,127,85,89,81,236,112,154,90,84,5,189,221,79,35,153,68,175,213,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
