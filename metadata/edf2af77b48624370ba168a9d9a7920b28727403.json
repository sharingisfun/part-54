This IS NOT a commercial release.\nDO NOT confuse this with the Andy Warhol film that I uploaded as a DVDR here: \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4041452&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/tor/4041452&lt;/a&gt; \n\nThis is a -ultra low- quality film for you that are interested in taking a peak at the Factory scene and the Velvet Underground.  \n\nThe Velvet Underground and Nico are present in this film and their sound is distorted if it is there at all. The sound does not sync up with the film and leads me to believe that it was taken from another source. Also in the crowd are Andy Warhol, Allen Ginsberg, Barbara Rubin, Tuli Kupferberg, Peter Orlovsky, Ed Sanders, Gererd Malanga and Storm De Hirsch.\n\nThis film includes glimpses from JAN. 13, 1966 when Andy Warhol was invited to speak at the annual banquet  of the New York Society for Clinical Psychiatry at the Delmonico Hotel. He brought along the VELVETS and other factory regulars. It was the first time that NICO performed publicly with the band.\n\nAlso in the film are glimpses of The Velvet Underground at The Dom.\n\nI know very little about this film. It was shot and edited by someone who regularly attended the Factory scene parties. The quality is that of a home movie, because that is exactly what this is. The film ends as abruptly as it begins. There are alot of bizzare and sudden camera movements, blurred images, and strange lighting.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:edf2af77b48624370ba168a9d9a7920b28727403","amp;dn":"The+Velvet+Underground+-+Super+8+Films","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"edf2af77b48624370ba168a9d9a7920b28727403","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,242,175,119,180,134,36,55,11,161,104,169,217,167,146,11,40,114,116,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
