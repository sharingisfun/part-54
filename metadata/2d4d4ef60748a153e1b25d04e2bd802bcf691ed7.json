They also play fine with XBMC. The quality is very good to watch on a regular TV so don\\&amp;#039;t think that these are bad quality just because they are encoded for iPod. The original quality of these episodes doesn\\&amp;#039;t really justify encoding with anything better anyways :) \n\n\nI haven\\&amp;#039;t seen this on here so I don\\&amp;#039;t know if anyone really wants this.
