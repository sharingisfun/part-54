Then record albums can hold their own top-40, twenty minutes per side.\n\nPoint four: One minute is also the length of most commercials, and therefore their corresponding jingles.\n\nPoint five: Jingles are the music of America.\n\nConclusion: This compact disc is terrific in shuffle play. To convert the jingles to pop music, program each song to repeat three times.\n\n\nThis was before Demolition Man, folks! The Residents are VISIONARIES!\n\nBonus tracks: Yet four more 1-minute songs, three covers of American commercial singles and three more since the Residents thought there should be 50.\n\nFormat: 256kbps average bitrate Ogg/Vorbis.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7667fe2e104da5d2c2ea425014c4256f3c770a8d","amp;dn":"The+Residents+-+Commercial+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7667fe2e104da5d2c2ea425014c4256f3c770a8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,103,254,46,16,77,165,210,194,234,66,80,20,196,37,111,60,119,10,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
