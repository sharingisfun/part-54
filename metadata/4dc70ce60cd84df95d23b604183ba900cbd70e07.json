Smoking in the bathroom Ã¢â‚¬â€ a bad habit made worse when shards of flaming toilet start flying. But is it really possible to explode a commode by spraying a flammable substance down the bowl then lighting a match? Jamie and Adam find out if this myth holds water. Speaking of soggy, do you get wetter running or walking in the rain? And can assassins use bullets made of ice in order to not leave evidence in their victims? Our guys put these fables to the test. \n\nSvensk text","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dc70ce60cd84df95d23b604183ba900cbd70e07","amp;dn":"Mythbusters+-+Ice+Bullet%2C+Exploding+Toilet%2C+Who+Gets+Wetter","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dc70ce60cd84df95d23b604183ba900cbd70e07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,199,12,230,12,216,77,249,93,35,182,4,24,59,169,0,203,215,14,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
