DIAL HAS SOMETHING TO SAY explores the topic of racism and classism in the elite world of visual arts, focusing on the experiences of 78-year-old African-American artist, Thornton Dial. If explores in subtle detail the complexities of the Contemporary Art Market. \n\nThe film follows the discovery of Thornton Dial in Alabama by art collector and historian Bill Arnett in the late 1980s. Despite being poor, and having never studied past third grade, Dial&amp;#039;s talent was immediately accepted by the art world. His unprecedented meteoric rise in the elite New York City art world culminated in 1993, when his show opened in two prestigious venues on the same night. White art insiders compared his talent with Picasso and Chagall. Three days later, 60 Minutes aired a condescending segment, which made Dial look like an ignorant, uneducated old black man, and portrayed Arnett as an exploiter. Every museum canceled any and all plans for future Dial shows. For the next 13 years, Arnett and Dial work to defend their relationship and regain the lost ground.\n\nMichael Kimmelman and Thelma Golden declined to be interviewed for this film.\n\n \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0dc81662349f47307bd4488a053bafebe682a29","amp;dn":"Mr.+Dial+Has+Something+to+Say+--+2007+--+57min","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0dc81662349f47307bd4488a053bafebe682a29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,220,129,102,35,73,244,115,7,189,68,136,160,83,186,254,190,104,42,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
