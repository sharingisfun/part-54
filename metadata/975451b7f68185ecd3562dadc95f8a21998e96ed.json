The publisher attempted a relaunch almost immediately, with a new ongoing series titled Punisher, by writer John Ostrander, in which the Punisher appeared to willingly join and work for organized crime.\n\nI have called this collection Volume 2A (also known as Marvel Edge Punisher) because it takes place after the long running v2 but before Garth Ennis started on Volume 3\n\nI Have included the final story arc of The Punisher v2, Punisher War Journal v1 and Punisher War Zone called &quot;Countdown&quot; which ended those three titles. This leads directly into the Double edge Crossover, crossing into Daredevil and Incredible Hulk, where the Punisher goes after Nick Fury. I have numbered these issues in read order.\n\nFinally Punisher relaunch issues 1 - 18 complete.\n\nPlease be patient with my crappy upload speed\n\nThanks to the original scanners!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:975451b7f68185ecd3562dadc95f8a21998e96ed","amp;dn":"Punisher+V2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"975451b7f68185ecd3562dadc95f8a21998e96ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,84,81,183,246,129,133,236,211,86,45,173,201,95,138,33,153,142,150,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
