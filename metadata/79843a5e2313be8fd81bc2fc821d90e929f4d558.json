This tragic tale exposes the abuse of capitalism and class during in Dicken&amp;#039;s England as well as the lack of regard for children.  There are heroes, to be sure, but, oddly, it is not only vice, but also the sanctity of family that brings most of the hardships.  Interesting subplots as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:79843a5e2313be8fd81bc2fc821d90e929f4d558","amp;dn":"The+Old+Curiosity+Shop+-+Charles+Dickens","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"79843a5e2313be8fd81bc2fc821d90e929f4d558","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,132,58,94,35,19,190,143,216,27,194,252,130,29,144,233,41,244,213,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
