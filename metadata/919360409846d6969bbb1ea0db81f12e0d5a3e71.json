Diverse credits and claims have led to confusion as to its authorship and genesis. It tells the story of a man on the run after shooting his wife. The earliest known commercial recording, and the first hit version, is the late 1965 recording by the Los Angeles garage band, The Leaves, although currently the best-known version is the The Jimi Hendrix Experience&amp;#039;s 1966 recording, their debut single. The song title is sometimes given as &quot;Hey Joe, Where You Gonna Go?&quot; or similar variations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:919360409846d6969bbb1ea0db81f12e0d5a3e71","amp;dn":"Jimi+Hendrix+-+Hey+Joe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"919360409846d6969bbb1ea0db81f12e0d5a3e71","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,147,96,64,152,70,214,150,155,187,30,160,219,129,241,46,13,90,62,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
