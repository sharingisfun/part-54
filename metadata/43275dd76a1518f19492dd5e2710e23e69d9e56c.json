It depicts six distinct stages of Dylan&amp;#039;s \nlife and public persona portrayed by an ensemble cast\n of actors: Marcus Carl Franklin, Ben Whishaw, Heath \nLedger, Christian Bale, Richard Gere, and Cate Blanchett,\n who play characters based on Dylan but with different\n names.[1]\n\nThe film tells its story using non-traditional\n techniques, similar to the poetic narrative style\n of Dylan&amp;#039;s songwriting. It takes its name from the\n Dylan outtake &quot;I&amp;#039;m Not There&quot;, a song never officially\n released until its appearance on the film&amp;#039;s official\n soundtrack album. Critically acclaimed, I&amp;#039;m Not There\n made many top ten film lists for 2007, topping the lists\n for The Village Voice, Entertainment Weekly, Salon and\n The Boston Globe\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43275dd76a1518f19492dd5e2710e23e69d9e56c","amp;dn":"I%5C%27m+Not+there+%282007%29DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43275dd76a1518f19492dd5e2710e23e69d9e56c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,39,93,215,106,21,24,241,148,146,221,94,39,16,226,62,105,217,229,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
