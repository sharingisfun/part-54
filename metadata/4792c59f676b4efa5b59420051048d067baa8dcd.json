And I&amp;#039;m sharing it as an experiment. Without this, I would not have been able to watch this excellent film. \n\nBelieve me, I tried.\n\n\nOk, here&amp;#039;s the deal: \n\nI have Vertigo, the actual medical condition that causes spells of dizziness, often triggered by motion.\n\nI really wanted to see this movie, but didn&amp;#039;t want to barf, or even take the chance that feeling nauseous would discract from the pace/energy of the film.\n\nSo, I &quot;steadied&quot; the entire movie using the excellent virtualdub plugin DeShaker. I highly reccommend it for your own home movies.\n\nConclusions:\n\nThe process actually worked quite well. What you will see, is that because the shooting is so wild/freehand, steadying the content makes the &amp;#039;frame&amp;#039; of the movie swing and rotate in the exact opposite way. If you have a zoom control on your DVD remote, you may want to use it a little to eliminate some of the border swing. You&amp;#039;ll see what I mean when you try it.\n\nThat said, this isn&amp;#039;t perfect,  don&amp;#039;t yell at me because its not a perfect rip. That&amp;#039;s not the point. I did this as an experiment, and I&amp;#039;ll tell you what, for me, it actually worked, despite the distraction of the frame moving. Someone with vertigo will actually rather have the frame move than the content. \n\nYou&amp;#039;ll also see things you missed, because the camera now keeps the main subject(s) centered.\n\n\nCoded with XVID.\n\nPlease comment and let me know your thoughts.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4792c59f676b4efa5b59420051048d067baa8dcd","amp;dn":"Blair+Witch+Steadi-cam+VERTIGO+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4792c59f676b4efa5b59420051048d067baa8dcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,146,197,159,103,107,78,250,91,89,66,0,81,4,141,6,123,170,141,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
