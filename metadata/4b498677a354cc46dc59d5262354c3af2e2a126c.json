At the end of 2003 the band had a change of heart because 3 of it&amp;#039;s members (Christian Poulin, Sebastien Audet and Simon Charette) left to revive another band named Descend into nothingness. Finally D.I.N gave up for personal reasons in the year of 2005. Afterwards Francis Beaulieu, Simon Charette, Christian Poulin and Sebastien Audet gave birth to the project who now wears the name of Archons. The band has also recorded 2 promo songs (Delusional Beliefs, Plague of Corruption) with Pascal Letendre. \n\nLabel: Cryogenic Records \nFormed: 2003 \nLocation: Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec \nGenre: Technical Melodic Death Metal \nLyrical Theme: Society, Rebellion \n\nCurrent Line Up \nSebastien Audet - Vocals, Bass \nFrancis Beaulieu - Guitars \nSimon Charette - Guitars \nChristian Poulin - Drums \n\nAssociated Bands \nDescend Into Nothingness \n_______________________________________ \n\nPrevious Albums \nPromo 2006 \nThis is their debut album! \n_______________________________________ \n\nLinks  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cryogenicrecords.net/archons/index.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cryogenicrecords.net/archons/index.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b498677a354cc46dc59d5262354c3af2e2a126c","amp;dn":"Archons+-+2008+-+The+Consequences+Of+Silence","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b498677a354cc46dc59d5262354c3af2e2a126c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,73,134,119,163,84,204,70,220,89,213,38,35,84,195,175,46,42,18,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
