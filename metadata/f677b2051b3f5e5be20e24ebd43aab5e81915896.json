Ugly characters line up in the songs\nlike early arrivals at a monster truck rally. Most significantly, there's the murderer in 'Fish Fry.' Who else\nbut Steve Albini could paint the picture of a man hosing out his truck after chucking a dead body from it\ninto a nearby pond? His use of the first person can be misleading, but it's a necessary perspective for effect.\nBig Black left with more of a kling klang than a bang, bowing out with a reverent cover of Kraftwerk's 'The Model.'\n\nTo sum up: yowl, ching, thump-thump-screech.\n\n\n01.
