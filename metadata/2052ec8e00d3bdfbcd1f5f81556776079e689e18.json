WRONG. This is the truth about that pathetic excuse for a tolerant &amp;#039;open discussion&amp;#039; forum, is really a hypocritical propaganda site meant to hide the true teachings of the Bible, and that includes John Calvin&amp;#039;s personal repetition and explanations of them. If you mention that you have eternal life of believe in Christ or love God in the general Christianity section you will be called a spammer, troll, and proselytizer. You see you must be a robot that doesn&amp;#039;t mention your beliefs if you are misidentified as a Calvinistic Christian, in other words, a Christian that loves God and believe the Bible (in the original languages) to be perfectly true regardless of what anyone thinks of it.\n\nThe evidence that this is an anti-truth propaganda site is in the zipped folder. You may notice how a mere id mentioning John Calvin is enough to get you banned within seconds and how the user called seed was banned for asking why the moderator Sunstone was making false accusations against me without justification. The evil moderator/s are so dishonorable that they delete the posts that hurt their minds so that no one will see their evil behavior refuted.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://eternian.blogspot.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://eternian.blogspot.com&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2052ec8e00d3bdfbcd1f5f81556776079e689e18","amp;dn":"ReligiousForums.com_Doesn%5C%27t_Tolerate_Calvinism.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2052ec8e00d3bdfbcd1f5f81556776079e689e18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,82,236,142,0,211,189,251,205,31,95,129,85,103,118,7,158,104,158,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
