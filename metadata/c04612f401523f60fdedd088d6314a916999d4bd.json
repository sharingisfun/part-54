If you listen close enough you can clearly hear the musical plagiarism of bands such as the white stripes, the beatles, wilco, and the rolling stones among others. Their first studio album produced by Shane Hines is set for national release on iTunes Thursday, April 10th, 2008. Physical copies are shipping coast-coast as you read this... so be ready. You&amp;#039;ll find MHR playing at local venues such as Jammin Java in Vienna, TT Reynolds in Fairfax, as well as at some farther spots like The 8x10 in Baltimore . They have also played with local and nationally touring acts such as The Von Bondies, Shane Hines &amp; the Trance, The Beautiful Girls, Kill The Alarm, The Cliks, The Blackjacks, The Hint, and The Drugstore Cowboys.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c04612f401523f60fdedd088d6314a916999d4bd","amp;dn":"mhr-potterhollow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c04612f401523f60fdedd088d6314a916999d4bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,70,18,244,1,82,63,96,253,237,208,136,214,49,74,145,105,153,212,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
