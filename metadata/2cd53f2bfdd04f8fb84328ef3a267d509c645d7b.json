Arizona. Then, it's payback time. Choose from 14 aircraft,\n\n  including famous planes such as the Corsair, P-51 Mustang and B-25 bomber.\n\n  You'll dogfight, dive-bomb and torpedo the Japanese forces in 10 missions\n\n  all drawn from the Pacific campaign battles of World War II, including\n\n  Guadalcanal, The Battle of Midway, and Okinawa.\n\n  \n\n  &quot;Yeah, Moe, that team sure did suck last night. They just plain sucked!\n\n   I've seen teams suck before, but they were the suckiest bunch of sucks that\n\n   ever sucked.&quot; -Homer Simpson\n\n-------------\nby KillerPC\nto Lionetwork\nWww.LioNetwork.Net","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2cd53f2bfdd04f8fb84328ef3a267d509c645d7b","amp;dn":"Pearl+Harbor%3A+Zero+Hour+-+The+Game%2C+by+KillerPC+to+Lionetwork","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2cd53f2bfdd04f8fb84328ef3a267d509c645d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,213,63,43,253,208,79,143,184,67,40,239,58,38,125,80,156,100,93,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
