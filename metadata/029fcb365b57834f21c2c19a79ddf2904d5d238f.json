Guitarist Cafritz and bassist Gordon began playing out, offering their audiences short sets of post-punk numbers. They put out Call Now/Straight Up later that year, and proceeded on the Lollapalooza tour. Their singles include &amp;quot;Oh Bondage, Up Yours,&amp;quot; which was originally done by X-Ray Spex. Yoshimi, of the Boredoms, joined the group in 1993, contributing harmonica, trumpet, and drums, as well as occasional vocals. Bass player Mark Ibold, of Pavement, came aboard the following year. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:029fcb365b57834f21c2c19a79ddf2904d5d238f","amp;dn":"Free+Kitten+-+3+CD+%2B+1+EP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"029fcb365b57834f21c2c19a79ddf2904d5d238f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,159,203,54,91,87,131,79,33,194,193,154,121,221,242,144,77,93,35,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
