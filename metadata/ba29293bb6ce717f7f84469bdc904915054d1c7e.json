Daniel manages to talk his way out of some \nfights but is finally cornered by several who belong to the \nsame karate school. As Daniel is passing out from the beating \nhe sees Miyagi, the elderly gardner leap into the fray and \nsave him by outfighting a half dozen teenagers. Miyagi and \nDaniel find the real motivator behind the boys' violent \nattitude is the their karate teacher. Miyagi promises to teach \nDaniel to fight and arranges a fight at a karate contest some \nmonths off. When his training begins, Daniel can't understand \nwhat he is being shown. Miyagi seems more interested in having \nDaniel paint fences and wax cars than teaching him Karate. \n\n\nThis is for all you old school movie fans.\n\nQuality: DVD Rip Divx 512x384\n# of Cds: 1 \n\n...enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba29293bb6ce717f7f84469bdc904915054d1c7e","amp;dn":"The+Karate+Kid+Part+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba29293bb6ce717f7f84469bdc904915054d1c7e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,41,41,59,182,206,113,127,127,132,70,155,220,144,73,21,5,77,28,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
