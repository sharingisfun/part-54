Perfect production and arranging.  Great vocals and musical performances.  And if I had to choose a song to dance around the floor to, it would be &amp;quot;Love Letter&amp;quot; without a doubt.  Bonnie blends a mixture of blues with funk and rock and roll effortlessly and this album surely deserved all the accolades it received. A must-have for any great music collection.\n \nBonnie Raitt\nNick Of Time (1989)\nCD to mp3 @ 320 kbps + covers\nApprox 98.5Mb\n\nTracks\n01 Nick Of Time\n   (Bonnie Raitt)\n02 Thing Called Love\n   (John Hiatt)\n03 Love Letter\n   (Bonnie Hayes)\n04 Cry On My Shoulder\n   (Michael Ruff)\n05 Real Man\n   (Jerry L.
