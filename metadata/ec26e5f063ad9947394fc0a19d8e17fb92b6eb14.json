He was created by writer Steve Gerber and first appeared in the pages of 1974&amp;#039;s Man-Thing. He also had a ten-issue limited series that ran from 1990 to 1991. There have been three different individuals to adopt the mantle of the Foolkiller. The character was inspired by a Southern legend that was the basis for a short story by O. Henry. This in turn was the inspiration for a later novel by Helen Eustis. The novel was made into a film featuring Anthony Perkins. A character of the same name also appeared in L. Frank Baum&amp;#039;s The Enchanted Island of Yew.[/quote]\n\nBIG THANKS to all the scanners involved.\n\nIF YOU LIKE THE BOOK, THEN BUY THE COMICS OR THE TRADES.
