It contains a sample of &quot;Go Down Dying&quot; by Antonio Carlos Jobim. The lyrics reflect on human nature and emotion from an animal&amp;#039;s point of view. The song is the first part of a trilogy that includes &quot;Isobel&quot; and &quot;Bachelorette&quot;.\n\n&quot;Human Behaviour&quot; was an underground smash, and reached #36 in the UK Singles Chart. It is often performed on her recent concerts as an encore.\n\nThe music video, directed by Michel Gondry, is a loose take on the children&amp;#039;s tale &quot;Goldilocks and the Three Bears&quot;, with visuals inspired by Yuri Norstein&amp;#039;s animated film Hedgehog in the Fog. Unlike in the story, however, BjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶rk is hunted by a bear in a forest. She also flies to the moon where she plants a Soviet flag. She ends up being eaten by the bear and trapped in its stomach. The video received six nominations for the MTV Video Music Awards of 1994 including Best Female Video, Best New Artist in a Video, Breakthrough Video, Best Special Effects, Best Art Direction and Best Direction (for Gondry&amp;#039;s work), winning none. Also this video was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Music Video - Short Form losing to Peter Gabriel&amp;#039;s &quot;Steam&quot;.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a968e45dd661a10ef3caaefb3c1d397f77424518","amp;dn":"Bjork+-+Human+Behaviour","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a968e45dd661a10ef3caaefb3c1d397f77424518","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,104,228,93,214,97,161,14,243,202,174,251,60,29,57,127,119,66,69,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
