Baginski's care for detail and his characteristic style are even more evident than in his first film - it's a real treat.\n\nAnd let's not forget just a little touch of macabre... well maybe even a bit more than a little this time...\n\nAll in all, a great piece of art. If you think you've seen great computer animation in full-length movies like &quot;Sky Captain...&quot; or &quot;Shrek&quot; or whatever, then see &quot;The Cathedral&quot; and &quot;Fallen Art&quot; and think again. Baginski's in a class all of his own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ace1f1e9d78c0d322d99d9cda25099a6ea011f7","amp;dn":"Fallen+Art+%5B3D+animation%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ace1f1e9d78c0d322d99d9cda25099a6ea011f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,206,31,30,157,120,192,211,34,217,157,156,218,37,9,154,110,160,17,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
