This show is from Seattle and features some great songs, including &quot;Ring on the Sill,&quot; the always welcome &quot;Upon Still Waters,&quot; and &quot;Dragging Hooks,&quot; which had just been debuted a few weeks earlier in New Mexico.\n\n \n\nPlus, quite frankly, this show contains &quot;Something More Besides You&quot; for the first encore, so it has two of my all time favorite Junkies&amp;#039; tunes (&quot;Ring&quot; being the other). I remember the excitement I felt when I saw this setlist and popped the show in to listen to after receiving it. Hopefully you&amp;#039;ll all like it as well.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ada5908b6c6b52a8188e8e92040b0c89073b986","amp;dn":"Cowboy+Junkies+2000-06-13+%40+Moore+Theater+-+Seattle%2C+WA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ada5908b6c6b52a8188e8e92040b0c89073b986","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,218,89,8,182,198,181,42,129,136,232,233,32,64,176,200,144,115,185,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
