It's quick to install, and it's stable! It's great for small\nhard drives. You'll notice not very many services running in the background, too. It boots fast and shuts down quick.\n\nIf you're ever in the need for an extremely light version of XP, then this disc will\nbe right for you. You'll still be able to get on-line and do everything else, except\nthat you won't have all the BS that Microsoft forces you to install - that you will\nnever use.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2e374ee92fa5539cd4fea87b42bb4d7a744ecde","amp;dn":"WindowsXP+Pro+SP2+Corporate+%28Stripped+to+the+Bone+Edition%29.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2e374ee92fa5539cd4fea87b42bb4d7a744ecde","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,227,116,238,146,250,85,57,205,79,234,135,180,43,180,215,167,68,236,222]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
