While this is over 12 years old...this woman can belt it out. She got her start singing in front of a very tough crowd at the Apollo theatre! Yes, the &quot;Live at The Apollo&quot; show, where people boo&amp;#039;d you right off the stage, while sandman wrapped his ready cane around your neck wisking you hastilly off the stage in embarrasment and horror.This young lady not only won but had the whole audience give her props as she sang &amp;#039;Respect&quot; by Aretha Fanklin. Yes a little white girl from Westchester singing the queen of soul&amp;#039;s biggest hit in front of a mostly African-American audience. Too funny, but true all the less.\nShe quickly rose to fame (not 15 minutes, more like 45 minutes) had two big hits...and basically disappeared after HOT 97 went down the tubes, thanks to Nirvana! Music changed, and so did the industry, to the tune of Freestyle&amp;#039;s quick and painless demise. If you love great European-style, Bananarama-esque music, get this!\n\n\nTrack Listing: ---- \n\nThis Is The Last Time --- \nIf I Could Turn Back The Hands Of Time --- \nRed Light Green Light --- \nEspecially For You --- \nLove Makes The World Go Round --- \nOur Love --- \nSay I&amp;#039;m Your Number One [Album Version &amp;#039;92] --- \nBoy I Can&amp;#039;t Cry --- \nBetter The Devil You Know [Album Version] --- \nTake Me Back ---","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ee40b41029c47bb9aaf474ce5de8c449f1151c0a","amp;dn":"Laura+Enea+-+Laura+Enea+%281992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ee40b41029c47bb9aaf474ce5de8c449f1151c0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,64,180,16,41,196,123,185,170,244,116,206,93,232,196,73,241,21,28,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
