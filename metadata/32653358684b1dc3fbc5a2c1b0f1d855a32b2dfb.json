Armed\n with unrelenting energy and three tonnes of sheer wit, the unsung \n heroes of Waterloo, Ontario are set to tell their tale of musical \n wizardry.                                                         \n                                                                   \n In keeping with the haunting Tom Waits composition that spawned   \n their name, What?s He Building In There? have ripened their own   \n deranged fruit in the form of their debut self-titled LP. Drawing \n influence from the contrasting musical worlds of Mike Patton,     \n Tool, Les Claypool, Between the Buried and Me, Frank Zappa and    \n many other innovators, WHBIT? have synthesized their many facets  \n into one gripping and demented melodic masterpiece. Clocking in at\n just over 54 minutes, this self-produced saga will dash the       \n preconceptions of heavy music listeners everywhere.               \n                                                                   \n ?When the guys were writing the music for this album,? explains   \n band mascot Dr. Bronson, ?they gave each song character by not    \n ripping off their own riffs. Anyone caught writing a clone riff   \n was subject to childish name calling.? Guitarist Chris Cookson    \n adds, ?I think looking for additional inspiration away from metal \n music, and music in general, was an important part of our         \n process.?                                                         \n                                                                   \n In the winter of 2007, What?s He Building In There? signed with   \n Year of the Sun Records and engineered a selfless theatrical stage\n show with absolutely no regard for personal beauty, and a high    \n regard for groove and astonishment. With their record on the verge\n of being unleashed and a video in the works for the single        \n ?Avian&quot;.                                                          \n===================================================================\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32653358684b1dc3fbc5a2c1b0f1d855a32b2dfb","amp;dn":"What%5C%27s+He+Building+in+There%3F+-+What%5C%27s+He+Building+in+There","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32653358684b1dc3fbc5a2c1b0f1d855a32b2dfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,101,51,88,104,75,29,195,251,197,162,193,176,241,216,85,163,43,45,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
