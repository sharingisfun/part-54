You never actually get into the cockpit, but you control your ship and, if necessary, wings (groups) of ships from a third-person perspective. Navigating through various missions, you employ an extensive inventory screen in order to equip ships on your team, buy and trade goods with the mothership and more. The detailed ship designs complement the beautiful, varied space environments, creating an aesthetically-pleasing tactical experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aec2b7ce2efc66c7f2757b2242e21bea8f0ff21","amp;dn":"Star+Wolves+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aec2b7ce2efc66c7f2757b2242e21bea8f0ff21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,236,43,124,226,239,198,108,127,39,87,178,36,46,33,190,168,240,255,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
