Stephen Kings novel about the twisted love affair between a boy and his car gets transferred to the screen, courtesy of suspense master John Carpenter. Although lacking some of the more outre supernatural elements of the source material, this high octane cinematic tuneup more than delivers the goods, horrorwise (Christines midnight rampages will never be forgotten) as well as being a sly expose of the random cruelties within the high school pecking order. Keith Gordon (who has gone on to become a stellar director in his own right, with films such as A Midnight Clear and Mother Night to his credit) gives a wonderfully controlled central performance. Carpenters atmospheric original score is backed up by a well chosen collection of rock classics, including George Thorogood&amp;#039;s &quot;Bad to the Bone&quot; (the titular character&amp;#039;s all too apt theme song).\n\nAdditional Details:\n\nAlso Known As: John Carpenters Christine (USA) (complete title)\n\nRuntime: 111 min\n\nCountry: USA\n\nLanguage: English\n\nColor: Color (Metrocolor)\n\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\n\nSound Mix: Dolby \n\nDVD Format: Unmodified exact copy of Widescreen formatted DVD.
