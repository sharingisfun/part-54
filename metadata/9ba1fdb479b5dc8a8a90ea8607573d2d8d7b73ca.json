Obvious hits have more chance than weird indie tracks.  Voting for someone elses suggestion will give it more chance too.\nThanks to all of you who looked at my wifes new perfume business and congratulations to the many who decided to take it on, and who are now making some handy extra cash. What amazed me most of all was the international effect, as my wife has now inroduced people in 7 different countries. For those who asked, virtually any country can join in, even Russia, Italy and Belgium have now started up.\n\nTo see a picture of my wife go to www.newsmells.info \n\nSF264-01 - BassHunter - Now You&amp;#039;re Gone.zip                                          \nSF264-02 - Adelle - Chasing Pavements.zip                                            \nSF264-03 - Souljah boy tell em - Crank That.zip                                      \nSF264-04 - Jay Sean - Ride It.zip                                                    \nSF264-05 - The Feeling - I Thought It Was Over.zip                                   \nSF264-06 - Kelly Rowland - Work (Freemasons Mix).zip                                 \nSF264-07 - Kanye West ft Chris Martin - Homecoming.zip                               \nSF264-08 - Kylie Minogue - Wow.zip                                                   \nSF264-09 - Hot chip - Ready For The Floor.zip                                        \nSF264-10 - The Maccabees - Toothpaste Kisses.zip                                     \nSF264-11 - Rihana - Don&amp;#039;t Stop The Music.zip                                         \nSF264-12 - Jennifer Lopez - Hold It Don&amp;#039;t Drop It.zip                                \nSF264-13 - Lupe Fiasco ft Matthew Santos - Superstar.zip                             \nSF264-14 - Goldfrap - A&amp;E.zip                                                        \nSF264-15 - Jack Johnson - If I Had Eyes.zip\n\nSFMW896-01 - Queen - Princes Of The Universe.zip                                     \nSFMW896-02 - Nirvana - Heart-shaped Box.zip                                          \nSFMW896-03 - The Who - Seeker, The.zip                                               \nSFMW896-04 - James Brown - Get Up Offa That Thing.zip                                \nSFMW896-05 - Fun Loving Criminals - Loco.zip                                         \nSFMW896-06 - Paul McCartney - Tug Of War.zip                                         \nSFMW896-07 - Thin lizzy - Rosalie.zip                                                 \nSFMW896-08 - Kim Wilde - Chequered Love.zip                                          \nSFMW896-09 - The Eurythmics - It&amp;#039;s Alright Baby&amp;#039;s Coming Back.zip                    \nSFMW896-10 - The Beatles - And Your Bird Can Sing.zip                                \nSFMW896-11 - Kate Bush - Sensual World.zip                                           \nSFMW896-12 - The Bangles - Hero Takes A Fall.zip                                     \nSFMW896-13 - Alicia Keyes - No One.zip                                               \nSFMW896-14 - Def leppard - Animal.zip                                                \nSFMW896-15 - Electric Light Orchestra - Ma Ma Ma Belle.zip\n\nOn this disc I can take the blame for tracks 1,3,7,8,9 and 15 although in a couple of cases they just did another track by the same band, for example I actually requested &quot;Shine a little love&quot; by ELO and &quot;Pure &amp; Easy&quot; by The Who.\n\nIt is nice to see loads of you are uploading new karaoke material all the time, keep up the fantastic work. Remember to put the word Karaoke in the Torrent name, so we can find it. I am still looking for stuff on the Sing to the World label and we could do with some more vcd and dvd stuff.\n\nIf anyone else wants to take a look at the wifes perfume business you can find it at newsmells.com and .info\n\nI look forward to your karaoke requests. Let&amp;#039;s see some real crackers.\n\nEzeRoss\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ba1fdb479b5dc8a8a90ea8607573d2d8d7b73ca","amp;dn":"Sunfly+SF264+%26+SFMW896+Latest+Karaoke+CDG+Feb+2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ba1fdb479b5dc8a8a90ea8607573d2d8d7b73ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,161,253,180,121,181,220,138,138,144,234,134,7,87,61,45,141,123,115,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
