If they came up with more stuff like this, I would be addicted to the Box. Fantastic script, characters and acting and the funniest, freshest British made comedy I&amp;#039;ve seen since Spaced and (to a slightly lesser extent) The League of Gentlemen.\n\nAlthough I come from the north of England and lived in Manchester for two years and therefore, through direct association, find I can relate very naturally to this humour, it must surely transcend &amp;#039;northern&amp;#039; taste and appeal, in the same way that Phoenix Nights did, to absolutely anybody who sees it.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s no wonder Channel 4 are taking the unusual step of running the whole series again, as I think media interest/hype came too late this time round. It&amp;#039;s the only British thing to come remotely close to challenging the HBO stable (6ft Under/S.A.T.C) stuff that has attracted TV&amp;#039;s biggest plaudits in this last 4/5 years. I think it will go down as being an important landmark in British comedy broadcasting and gain cult status for years to come.\n\nCommissioning a series two is a must - it was just hitting full speed last night with the closing episode of this first run.\n\n9.3 Rating. In other words... Good shit! :o)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0614d9d8c6799ead26c6f3b829ccd2288c95f505","amp;dn":"Shameless+Season+1+%26+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0614d9d8c6799ead26c6f3b829ccd2288c95f505","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,20,217,216,198,121,158,173,38,198,243,184,41,204,210,40,140,149,245,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
